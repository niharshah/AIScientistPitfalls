# Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR) Using Advanced Neural Networks

## Overview

This project focuses on enhancing Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR) by leveraging advanced neural network architectures. Specifically, we employ Graph Wavelet Neural Networks (GWNNs) for structural representation, wavelet transforms for feature extraction, and Quantum-Inspired Deep Feedforward Neural Networks (QDFNNs) for classification. This hybrid approach aims to improve robustness against noise and generalization across diverse symbolic sequences. 

## Key Components

1. **Graph Wavelet Neural Networks (GWNNs)**: Utilized for transforming symbolic sequences into graph representations, capturing relational structures and dependencies within the data.

2. **Wavelet Feature Extraction**: Decomposes data into multiple frequency components, providing localization in both time and frequency domains, which helps focus on high-level patterns while also capturing detailed features.

3. **Quantum-Inspired Deep Feedforward Neural Networks (QDFNNs)**: Leverages principles from quantum mechanics, such as superposition, to thoroughly explore solution spaces and enhance resilience against noise.

## Methodology

- SPR sequences are initially transformed into graph representations via GWNNs.
- The graph signals are then decomposed using wavelet transforms to extract pertinent features.
- Finally, the transformed data is classified using a QDFNN, capable of handling complex decision boundaries typical in SPR tasks.
- A few-shot learning component is included to adapt to new rule sets swiftly with minimal data.

## Experimental Setup

- **Dataset**: A synthetic dataset designed to emulate SPR complexities, including Shape-Count, Color-Position, Parity, and Order rules.
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy is the primary metric, evaluated over training, validation, and test sets.
- **Implementation**: Consists of optimizing hyperparameters for GWNN and QDFNN components, employing preprocessing techniques and regularization to prevent overfitting.
  
## Results

- The training and validation accuracies stabilized around 50%, while test accuracy slightly exceeded random chance at 50.2%.
- These results suggest improvements are possible through hyperparameter optimization, better dataset representation, and enhanced preprocessing strategies.

## Potential Improvements

- Further hyperparameter tuning and alternate model configurations.
- Explore adaptive learning methods and more diverse data augmentation strategies.
- Augment the dataset to capture a broader range of symbolic complexities.

## Future Work

Ongoing research will focus on refining model parameters, enriching dataset representation, and optimizing preprocessing methods to boost performance. The integration of advanced methodologies from the literature, such as adaptive graph wavelets, will also be explored to establish a new benchmark for SPR tasks.
