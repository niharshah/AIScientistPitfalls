## Overview

This repository provides a baseline approach for symbolic pattern recognition. In our research, we employ a bag-of-tokens (CountVectorizer) representation combined with a logistic regression classifier. The main contributions are:

- **Sophisticated Token Extraction:** A custom regular expression pattern preserves critical symbolic tokens (e.g., ◊, □, •, Δ) to avoid loss of local dependencies.
- **Simple yet Robust Classification:** A logistic regression model (defined as f(x) = σ(Wx + b)) trained with the cross-entropy loss achieves notable accuracies.
- **Consistent Performance:** Our baseline model achieves training, development, and test accuracies of approximately 77.7%, representing an 11% improvement over the 70.0% baseline.

The detailed analysis in the accompanying paper discusses challenges in capturing both local and global symbolic patterns and lays groundwork for future integration with more advanced neuro-symbolic architectures.

## Highlights

- **Model Definition:**  
  The logistic regression classifier used is defined mathematically as:  
  f(x) = σ(Wx + b),  
  where the sigmoid function σ is defined as σ(z) = 1 / (1 + exp(-z)).

- **Loss Function:**  
  The cross-entropy loss is given by:  
  L = - (1/N) ∑ [y_i log(ŷ_i) + (1-y_i) log(1-ŷ_i)]

- **Experimental Outcomes:**  
  The evaluation on the SPR_BENCH dataset yields:
  - **Training Accuracy:** 77.69%
  - **Development Accuracy:** 77.90%
  - **Test Accuracy:** 77.72%

- **Visual Diagnostic Tools:**  
  The repository also includes plots (bar plot for accuracy comparison and a confusion matrix) to analyze misclassification patterns in-depth.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or later
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/symbolic-pattern-recognition.git
    cd symbolic-pattern-recognition
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

---

## Usage

To run the experiments and reproduce the reported results:

1. **Preprocessing and Tokenization:**  
   Execute the tokenization script which uses a custom regular expression to preserve all symbolic tokens:
   ```
   python src/tokenizer.py --input data/SPR_BENCH/train.txt --output data/SPR_BENCH/tokenized_train.txt
   ```

2. **Training the Model:**  
   Train the logistic regression classifier:
   ```
   python src/train.py --data_dir data/SPR_BENCH/ --max_iter 1000 --seed 42
   ```

3. **Evaluating the Model:**  
   After training, evaluation metrics (accuracy on training, development, and test splits) will be printed to the console as well as saved in the logs.

4. **Visualizing Results:**  
   The scripts generate visual plots (bar plot and confusion matrix) saved in the `figures/` directory for further diagnostic analysis.

## Experiments and Results

Our baseline experiments on the SPR_BENCH dataset confirm that:
- The bag-of-tokens feature extraction reliably captures symbolic structure.
- The logistic regression classifier outperforms the standard baseline (70.0%) by achieving ~77.7% accuracy.
- The low variance between training, validation, and test accuracies indicates a robust, generalizable model.
  
Detailed experimental procedures, along with discussions on limitations and future extensions (e.g., incorporating sequential models and neuro-symbolic approaches), are outlined in the research report included in the `paper/` directory.

## Future Work

Building on the results of this baseline approach, future research directions include:
- Enhancing the feature extraction process to capture sequential dependencies (e.g., RNNs, transformers).
- Integrating explicit rule extraction modules to combine symbolic reasoning with neural representations.
- Addressing potential class imbalances using advanced techniques such as focal loss or oversampling.
- Scaling the methodology to more heterogeneous datasets and testing in real-world applications (e.g., cybersecurity, NLP for code analysis).
