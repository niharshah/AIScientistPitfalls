# Research Report: Development of a Probabilistic and Graph-Based Hybrid Model for Symbolic Pattern Recognition

## Introduction
This repository contains the research and code associated with the development of a hybrid model for Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR). The model integrates probabilistic reasoning with graph-based methods to effectively recognize and interpret symbolic patterns, a challenging task due to the variability and complexity in symbol representation. The approach merges the strengths of Bayesian Networks, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), and deep learning techniques to improve accuracy and robustness in SPR tasks.

## Key Contributions
- A novel hybrid model that integrates probabilistic and graph-based methods for enhanced SPR.
- Utilization of Bayesian Networks and GCNs to understand probabilistic dependencies and structural patterns.
- Implementation of a one-shot learning framework with variational inference for uncertainty management in predictions.
- Extensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art methodologies to validate the model's robustness and accuracy.

## Methodology
The proposed model represents symbolic sequences as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes symbolize tokens and edges represent probabilistic dependencies. The graph structure leverages GCNs to capture structural patterns, and Bayesian Networks for probabilistic reasoning. Additionally, a ResNet-34 based embedding network and an attention mechanism focus on critical token interactions, improving recognition accuracy.

## Experimental Setup
Our experiments utilize a synthetic dataset that mimics real-world variability in symbolic patterns. The dataset is divided into training, development, and test subsets to evaluate model performance comprehensively. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with a fixed learning rate and batch size, with performance assessed through accuracy, F1-score, and entropy metrics.

## Results and Discussion
The initial results highlight areas for improvement, with the model achieving an accuracy of 49.80% and an F1 score of 0. This indicates the need for further refinements in hyperparameters, model architecture, and dataset representation. Despite these challenges, the study provides a foundation for exploring enhancements such as ensemble techniques, transfer learning, and improved loss functions.

## Future Work
Future research will focus on:
- Exploring deeper GCN architectures and alternative feature extraction networks.
- Enhancing the dataset with realistic augmentations to improve generalization.
- Examining ensemble learning and domain adaptation techniques for robust performance.
- Addressing class imbalance with advanced loss functions to stabilize learning.
