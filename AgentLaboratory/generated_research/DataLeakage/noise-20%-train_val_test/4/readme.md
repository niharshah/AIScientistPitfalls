# Hybrid Symbolic Pattern Recognition Framework

Welcome to the Hybrid Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR) Framework repository. This repository contains the code and resources necessary for developing and evaluating an advanced SPR framework designed to model and interpret symbolic sequences governed by complex rules.

## Overview

The Hybrid SPR Framework integrates advanced computational techniques such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Transformers, and a neuro-symbolic reasoning module, along with reinforcement learning (RL) for dynamic rule adaptation. Our aim is to overcome the challenges of symbolic pattern recognition by enhancing relational data interpretation, feature extraction, and logical rule-based inference.

## Features

- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** Utilized to model relationships and dependencies within symbolic sequences.
- **Transformers:** Implemented for feature extraction and capturing long-range dependencies.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Dynamic rule learning component for adaptability to unseen rule variations.
- **Attention Mechanisms:** Incorporated to refine GNN outputs and enhance interpretability.
- **Neuro-symbolic Reasoning:** Logical interpretation through probabilistic inference on symbolic data.

## Installation

To run the Hybrid SPR Framework, ensure that you have Python 3.8 or later installed. Recommended setup using `virtualenv`:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv env

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
.\env\Scripts\activate

# On MacOS/Linux
source env/bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**

   Prepare your dataset that mimics real-world symbolic sequence complexities. The dataset should include distinct rule categories such as Shape-Count, Color-Position, Parity, and Order.

2. **Training:**

   Train the model using the provided `train.py` script. This script configures the GNNs and Transformers, and begins the reinforcement learning process.

   ```bash
   python train.py --dataset ./data/your_dataset.csv --epochs 50
   ```

3. **Evaluation:**

   Evaluate the trained model using the `evaluate.py` script to assess accuracy and interpretability.

   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model ./models/spr_model.pth --test-data ./data/test_data.csv
   ```

## Results

Our framework has been evaluated on synthetically generated datasets with varying complexities. While the current accuracy falls short of the anticipated 70% benchmark, ongoing work focuses on model refinement and addressing imbalanced datasets.
