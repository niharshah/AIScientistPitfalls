# Enhancing Symbolic Pattern Recognition with Graph Neural Networks

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for our research project, "Enhancing Symbolic Pattern Recognition with Graph Neural Networks". This project explores the integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with symbolic reasoning to improve the interpretability and predictive accuracy of Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR) systems. Our approach bridges the gap between high-level symbolic reasoning and low-level data representation, making significant contributions to the field.

## Key Contributions

- **Novel GNN Architecture**: We propose a GNN architecture that incorporates dynamic graph convolution techniques with attention mechanisms to effectively discern critical patterns within symbolic sequences.
- **Neuro-symbolic Integration**: Our approach combines domain-specific symbolic rules with neural learning algorithms to facilitate robust symbolic reasoning.
- **Advanced Data Augmentation**: We introduce sophisticated data augmentation strategies to enrich the training dataset and enhance model generalization.

## Experimental Setup

Our experiments validate the proposed approach using a mixed dataset of synthetic and real-world symbolic sequences. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, showing improvements over existing models. However, identifying complex predicate combinations remains challenging and is a focus for future research.

## Results

- **Accuracy**: 70.57%
- **Precision**: 73.95%
- **Recall**: 70.57%
- **F1-score**: 69.28%

These results reflect the modelâ€™s potential but also indicate areas for improvement, particularly in dataset diversity and handling complex predicate combinations.

## Installation

To reproduce our results, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/symbolic-pattern-recognition-gnn.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd symbolic-pattern-recognition-gnn
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- **Data Representation**: Symbolic sequences are transformed into graph-based structures. Nodes represent symbols with features like shape and color, while edges denote predicate relationships.
- **Model Training**: Utilize the provided scripts to train the GNN model. Adjust hyperparameters as needed to optimize performance.

## Future Work

Improvements are aimed at expanding dataset diversity, exploring deeper network architectures, and integrating more sophisticated neuro-symbolic methods. Future research will focus on:

- Refining hyperparameters and enhancing training datasets.
- Testing advanced neural architectures for better pattern recognition.
- Extending applications to broader domains and real-time systems.
