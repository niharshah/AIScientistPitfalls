# Symbolic Pattern Recognition using Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Networks

## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of a research project focused on advancing Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR) using Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (DGCNN). SPR represents a significant challenge in machine learning, characterized by the complexity and variability inherent in identifying abstract patterns within symbol sequences. This project aims to improve the existing benchmarks by employing advanced graph-based neural network methodologies and embedding strategies.

## Abstract

SPR demands robust models due to its intrinsic complexity. Our approach utilizes a DGCNN for classifying dynamic symbol sequences and develops high-dimensional symbolic embeddings. We enhance model performance by integrating Arcface loss and cross-entropy loss to achieve superior class separability. Despite current results reflecting a need for further refinement, this research provides a foundational framework for future optimizations.
