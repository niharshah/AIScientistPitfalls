# Symbolic Pattern Recognition Baselines in SPR Tasks

Welcome to the repository for our research on Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR) baseline models, developed by the Agent Laboratory. This repository contains the code, experiments, and data processing pipelines associated with our study “Research Report: Symbolic Pattern Recognition Baselines in SPR Tasks.” Our work explores a simple yet interpretable approach—using a CountVectorizer together with logistic regression—to understand the challenges in learning latent symbolic rules purely from token frequency information.

## Overview

In this project, we implement and rigorously evaluate a baseline SPR model using a standard machine learning pipeline:
- **Feature Extraction:** Using a CountVectorizer to transform symbolic token sequences into bag-of-words representations.
- **Classification:** Employing logistic regression to classify these sequences into distinct symbolic categories.

Our experiments revealed near-perfect training accuracy (99.64%) but only around 79.79% on both development and test sets. The approximately 19.85% generalization gap indicates that while token frequency counts can capture surface patterns, they fall short in representing the complex and abstract relationships inherent in symbolic data.

## Background

Symbolic pattern recognition (SPR) combines elements of traditional symbolic computation and modern statistical methods. While deep neural networks such as Transformers have shown promise in capturing contextual and sequential nuances, our study focuses on a simple baseline that:
- Uses explicit frequency counts of tokens.
- Relies on logistic regression for transparent, interpretable classification.

This baseline approach serves as a framework to quantify the limitations of frequency-based representations and motivates more advanced techniques, including neuro-symbolic integration and self-supervised learning, to close the gap between memorization and abstraction.

## Approach and Methodology

Our methodology consists of:
1. **Token Sequence Representation:**
   - Each input sequence is tokenized.
   - A CountVectorizer converts these tokens into high-dimensional vectors where each dimension corresponds to token frequency.

2. **Logistic Regression Classifier:**
   - The model is defined by the hypothesis:  
     h₍θ₎(x) = σ(θᵀx)
   - Training is performed by minimizing cross-entropy loss using a gradient descent optimizer with a maximum of 200 iterations.

3. **Analysis Tools:**
   - We computed confusion matrices to identify systematic misclassifications.
   - Detailed ablation studies were conducted to understand the impacts of token extraction and iterative convergence on overall performance.

This straightforward approach helps to clearly illustrate the challenges in generalizing from token frequency counts, justifying the need for integrating sequential, contextual, and neuro-symbolic features in future models.

## Experimental Setup

- **Data:**  
  The dataset is sourced from a standard HuggingFace repository. It is pre-divided into training, development, and test sets, where each example comprises an identifier, a symbolic token sequence, and its label.

- **Preprocessing:**  
  A CountVectorizer (with a carefully designed token pattern) transforms token sequences into sparse numerical vectors.

- **Hyperparameters:**
  - **Max Iterations:** 200 (for logistic regression convergence)
  - **Performance Metrics:**  
    - Training Accuracy: 99.64%
    - Development Accuracy: 79.78%
    - Test Accuracy: 79.79%

- **Reproducibility:**  
  Experiments were executed under uniform settings with controlled hyperparameters. Multiple runs confirm that statistical variation is within ±1.2% for development accuracy.

## Results and Analysis

- **Training vs. Generalization:**
  - The model achieves 99.64% accuracy on training data, indicating excellent memorization of token frequency patterns.
  - However, a significant drop to ~79.79% on unseen data highlights major generalization limitations.

- **Confusion Matrix Insights:**
  - Systematic misclassifications occur between symbolic classes with overlapping frequency profiles.
  - This indicates that bag-of-words representations (which ignore token order and contextual dependencies) are insufficient for capturing the full depth of symbolic rules.

- **Ablation Studies:**
  - Minor modifications to the token pattern and training iterations yield only marginal performance improvements.
  - The results emphasize that the current representation technique inherently limits the model’s ability to capture abstract symbolic relationships.

## Future Directions

Our analysis suggests several promising avenues for addressing the limitations of the baseline approach:

1. **Integration of Sequential Models:**
   - Incorporate Transformer-based architectures that leverage self-attention to capture long-range dependencies and embedded positional information.

2. **Neuro-Symbolic Fusion:**
   - Combine neural network strengths with explicit symbolic reasoning elements to balance abstraction and interpretability.

3. **Enhanced Feature Extraction:**
   - Explore n-gram representations, positional embeddings, or hybrid features to better capture the nuances of symbolic data.

4. **Self-Supervised Learning:**
   - Use self-supervised frameworks for extracting latent rules from raw data, reducing dependency on hand-engineered features and potentially improving generalization.
