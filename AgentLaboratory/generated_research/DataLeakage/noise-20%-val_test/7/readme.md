# Enhanced Graph-Based Model with Attention Mechanisms for Symbolic Pattern Recognition

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources associated with the paper, _Research Report: Enhanced Graph-Based Model with Attention Mechanisms for Symbolic Pattern Recognition_. The study introduces an advanced graph-based neural network model that integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and Recurrent Graph Neural Networks (RGNNs) to tackle Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR) tasks. The model focuses on capturing both structural and temporal dependencies inherent in symbolic sequences using sophisticated attention mechanisms. The experimental results indicate a promising direction for SPR but also highlight areas for improvement.

- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required Python packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spr-graph-attention.git
cd spr-graph-attention
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the training and evaluation scripts to reproduce the results:

```bash
python src/train.py
```

The script will train the model on the provided synthetic dataset and output the results into the `/results` directory.

## Experimental Details

The model was trained and evaluated using a synthetic dataset under the Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) framework. Key experimental settings include:

- **Learning Rate**: 0.001
- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Epochs**: 5

## Results

The model achieved a test accuracy of 59.1%, indicating the need for further refinements in attention mechanisms and feature encoding strategies to meet state-of-the-art benchmarks.

## Future Work

Future efforts should focus on:

1. Enhancing attention layers and adopting transformer-like architectures.
2. Utilizing more sophisticated feature encoding schemes, such as symbol embeddings.
3. Extending datasets to include real-world complexity.
4. Implementing data augmentation and regularization techniques.
