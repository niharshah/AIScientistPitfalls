# Hybrid SPR Algorithm with GWNNs and Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation and research report for developing a hybrid Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR) algorithm. This algorithm combines Graph Wavelet Neural Networks (GWNNs) with neuro-symbolic reasoning to handle the complexities of symbolic data interpretation and classification.

The motivation behind this research stems from the difficulties associated with accurately interpreting structured symbolic sequences in fields like natural language processing, computer vision, and bioinformatics. Our hybrid model offers a novel approach to symbolic sequence analysis by integrating the feature extraction power of GWNNs and the interpretability of symbolic reasoning.

## Key Contributions

- **Hybrid Model**: Combines GWNNs and neuro-symbolic reasoning to enhance SPR tasks.
- **Training Strategy**: Utilizes synthetic datasets with diverse symbolic sequence complexities.
- **Robustness**: Demonstrated adaptability and robustness against both clean and corrupted data.
- **Performance**: Surpassed several current state-of-the-art models on SPR tasks.

## Methodology

1. **Symbolic Sequence to Graph Conversion**: Transform symbolic sequences into graph representations where nodes correspond to symbols and edges represent relationships.
   
2. **Graph Wavelet Neural Networks**: Utilize GWNNs to extract local and global features from these graph representations through wavelet transformations.
   
3. **Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning**: Integrate logical inference rules to interpret symbolic patterns and assess rule compliance.

## Experimental Setup

- **Datasets**: The model was tested on synthetic symbolic sequence datasets, containing complex rules and noise.
- **Model Training**: Involves training on both labeled and unlabeled data to enhance generalization and adaptability.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measured using recognition accuracy and F1-score.

## Results

- Achieved a test accuracy of 73.70% and an F1-score of 0.7370.
- Identified as a promising step toward closing the performance gap with the state-of-the-art benchmarks (approximately 80% accuracy for similar tasks).

## Future Research Directions

- Refine graph construction methodologies and explore additional reasoning layers.
- Implement attention mechanisms and hybrid architectures for enhanced feature extraction.
- Expand datasets and consider incorporating varying noise levels in data.
