# Symbolic Pattern Recognition Using Hybrid Models

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of a hybrid approach for Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR). The approach integrates Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (DGCNN) enhanced with attention mechanisms and Variational Autoencoders (VAE). The focus of this research is on addressing the inherent complexity and variability of symbolic sequences, which present significant challenges for traditional recognition systems. The proposed dual-model framework improves the accuracy and adaptability of SPR systems by capturing complex relationships and hidden patterns in symbolic sequences.

## Features
- **Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (DGCNN):** Captures intricate symbolic relationships using attention mechanisms to focus on important sequence parts.
- **Variational Autoencoders (VAE):** Manages learning from latent variable spaces to capture sequence variability.
- **Adaptive Learning Module:** Dynamically adjusts learning rates and attention configurations based on real-time feedback from misclassified sequences.
- **Rule-Based Synthetic Data Generation:** Creates datasets reflecting real-world symbolic complexities to enhance data diversity and model robustness.

## Results
The hybrid approach has demonstrated a significant reduction in training loss and achieved competitive accuracy on benchmark datasets. Key results include:
- **DGCNN Training Loss:** Reduced from 0.5952 to 0.0042 over 10 training epochs.
- **VAE Reconstruction Loss:** Reduced consistently from 0.2163 to 0.1379.
- **DGCNN Test Accuracy:** Achieved 69.70%, just below the state-of-the-art benchmark of 70.0%.
