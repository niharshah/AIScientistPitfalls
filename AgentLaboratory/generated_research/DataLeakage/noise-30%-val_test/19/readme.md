# Research Report: Developing a Robust SPR Algorithm Using Contrastive Learning and Adversarial Examples

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of our research on advancing Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR) using a hybrid model that incorporates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and contrastive learning, reinforced with adversarial examples. Our approach addresses the challenges of deciphering complex symbolic sequences governed by abstract, poly-factorial rules, aiming to surpass current state-of-the-art methods.

## Abstract

Our research aims to enhance SPR by utilizing contrastive learning and adversarial examples to determine hidden target rules in symbolic sequences. We employ a GNN framework enhanced with VAEs and multi-head attention mechanisms, embedding sequences into high-dimensional spaces to focus on critical components. Our experiments on synthetic datasets, spanning various rule categories (Shape-Count, Color-Position, Parity, and Order), demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline models, achieving a test accuracy of 69.50%.

## Contribution

- Development of a hybrid model integrating GNNs with VAEs and multi-head attention for nuanced SPR task interpretation.
- Leveraging contrastive learning and adversarial examples to improve model robustness and accuracy.
- Comprehensive evaluation on synthetic datasets to validate model efficacy across diverse symbolic patterns.

## Methodology

1. **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** Utilized for capturing relational dependencies in symbolic data.
2. **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** Encode symbolic sequences into latent space for sequence variations.
3. **Multi-Head Attention:** Focuses on significant sequence components to enhance interpretability.
4. **Contrastive Learning & Adversarial Examples:** Refine model robustness and adaptability to rule variations.

## Experimental Setup

- **Datasets:** Synthetic sequences based on diverse SPR task conditions.
- **Optimizer:** Adam with a learning rate of 0.001, trained over 50 epochs.
- **Evaluation:** Metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Ablation Study:** Explores component contributions like attention mechanisms and VAEs.

## Results

- The model achieved a test accuracy of 69.50%, demonstrating improved SPR task handling and highlighting areas for future refinement, especially in hyperparameter optimization.

## Future Work

- Systematic hyperparameter tuning employing Bayesian optimization or evolutionary strategies.
- Exploration of regularization techniques to handle complex adversarial examples.
- Application of the model in broader fields like linguistics and automated theorem proving.
