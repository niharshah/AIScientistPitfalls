# Enhanced Symbolic Pattern Recognition Algorithm

This repository contains the implementation of our research paper titled "Enhanced Symbolic Pattern Recognition Algorithm using Dynamic Graph CNN with Rule Embedding" developed by the Agent Laboratory. The goal of this project is to improve Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR) through the integration of Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (DGCNN) with a novel rule embedding mechanism.

## Overview

Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR) is critical in automated decision-making processes involving symbolic data with complex patterns found in domains like finance, science, and engineering. This repository provides a robust algorithm that:

- Converts symbolic sequences into graph representations.
- Encodes logical rules as vectors to enhance recognition accuracy.
- Integrates DGCNN with rule embedding to model intricate dependencies in symbolic data.

## Features

- **Graph-based Representations:** Utilizes DGCNN to transform symbolic sequences, capturing local and global dependencies.
- **Rule Embedding Mechanism:** Encodes logical rules as vectors to learn rule-specific features.
- **Advanced Data Augmentation:** Enhances training datasets to improve model generalization.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Assesses model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Implementation

The code is implemented in Python using the PyTorch framework, ensuring efficient training and evaluation of the model. The repository includes:

- Preprocessing scripts for converting symbolic sequences into graph representations.
- Model architecture for DGCNN and rule embedding integration.
- Training routines and evaluation scripts with configurable parameters.

## Datasets

The research utilizes both synthetic and real-world datasets:

- **Synthetic Data:** Created to simulate various symbolic attributes such as sequence length, shape, color, texture, and brightness.
- **Real-world Data:** Sourced from financial and scientific domains to challenge the model's ability to generalize.
