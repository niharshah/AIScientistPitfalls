# Symbolic Pattern Recognition Using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques

## Overview

This repository contains the code and research work for the paper titled "Research Report: Symbolic Pattern Recognition Using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques." The study explores a novel approach to symbolic pattern recognition (SPR) by leveraging advanced machine learning architectures, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Transformers, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and reinforcement learning strategies. The focus is on identifying and interpreting abstract symbolic sequences and underlying rules, offering applications across domains like document image analysis, computational linguistics, and automated reasoning.

## Objectives

- Introduce a GAN-based architecture to synthesize symbolic sequences and provide diverse training datasets reflecting various rule complexities and transformations.
- Develop a hybrid model combining Transformers and GNNs to capture sequence dependencies and model complex symbol interactions.
- Incorporate reinforcement learning with a curriculum learning approach to dynamically optimize attention mechanisms as the model progresses through increasingly complex rules.
- Evaluate model performance using cross-validation and a custom metric for "Rule Complexity Understanding," ensuring its robustness and scalability.

## Methodology

The methodology involves:
1. **Dataset Generation**: Using GANs to produce synthetic datasets that encapsulate complex rule structures.
2. **Model Architecture**: A hybrid implementation of Transformers and GNNs, with Transformers capturing sequence dependencies and GNNs modeling symbol interactions as graphs.
3. **Reinforcement Learning**:
   - Curriculum learning strategy for progressive exposure to complex rule sets.
   - Policy gradient methods for dynamic attention mechanism optimization.

### Experimental Setup

- **Dataset**: SPR\_BENCH, containing training, development, and test sets.
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and "Rule Complexity Understanding" (RCU).
- **Training**: Leveraging cross-validation, monitored alignment with performance goals, target 70% accuracy.

## Results & Discussion

- The model exhibited learning capability with steady gains in accuracy and precision metrics but did not surpass the 70% accuracy benchmark.
- Importance of advanced feature extraction and relational data modeling with GNNs is emphasized to improve interpretability and generalization.
- Proposed future directions include unsupervised and self-supervised learning paradigms along with dynamic graph convolution techniques.
