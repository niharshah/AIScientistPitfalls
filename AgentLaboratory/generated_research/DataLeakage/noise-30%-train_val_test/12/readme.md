# Research Report: Enhancing Symbolic PolyRule Reasoning with Graph Neural Networks and Attention Mechanisms

## Overview

This project presents a novel approach to tackle the Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) task using a combination of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and attention mechanisms, aimed at improving the interpretability and reasoning capabilities of models dealing with symbolic sequences. Our methodology integrates a multi-layer Graph Convolutional Network to capture relationships between symbols, with a Transformer block for focused attention. Neuro-symbolic integration is employed to embed logical rule representations within the model. Although our approach currently achieves an accuracy of 67.40%, there are outlined strategies for optimization with the aim to surpass the current state-of-the-art benchmark of 70.0%.

## Introduction

The SPR task challenges models to generalize and interpret hidden symbolic rules across sequences, demanding an advanced understanding of rule types like Shape-Count, Color-Position, Parity, and Order. This research employs the synergy between GNNs and attention mechanisms to enhance reasoning capabilities, positioning these models as benchmarks in artificial intelligence's pursuit of complex symbolic reasoning.

## Background

Our work leverages GNNs, particularly GCNs, to model relationships within graph-structured data. GCNs, along with attention mechanisms like Transformers, allow our model to capture long-range dependencies necessary for interpreting complex, rule-based sequences. Neuro-symbolic integration bridges symbolic AI's interpretability with the pattern recognition strengths of neural networks.

## Related Work

The task of SPR has seen approaches leveraging GNNs, with Kipf and Welling's GCNs serving as foundational models. Our deviation involves integrating attention mechanisms to enhance sequence interpretability. Furthermore, we draw on advances in neuro-symbolic integration to improve model decision transparency, diverging from methods like reinforcement learning which address rule deduction as decision-making processes.

## Methods

Our methodology integrates three key components:
- **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN):** Models structural relationships between symbols.
- **Transformer-based Attention Mechanism:** Provides focus on critical sequence parts.
- **Neuro-symbolic Integration:** Embeds logical rule representations, enhancing interpretability.

Mathematical formulations detail the convolution operation on graphs and the self-attention mechanism, elucidating our model's architecture.

## Experimental Setup

We used synthetic datasets reflecting diverse rule complexities, evaluating model performance via accuracy. Key hyperparameters included a learning rate of 0.01 and a batch size of 64. Implementation was conducted using PyTorch, initially with SGD optimization, with plans to explore Adam for improved convergence.

## Results

Our model achieved an accuracy of 67.40%, validating its potential with outlined improvement strategies like adopting the Adam optimizer and enhancing architectural depth. Comparative analysis against benchmarks shows our approach approaching competitive performance levels.

## Discussion

Bridging the performance gap requires optimization strategies such as advanced embedding techniques and enhancements in model architecture. Future work may explore robust data augmentation to improve generalization capabilities.

## Future Work

- **Optimization Strategies:** Transitioning to Adam optimizer, exploring architecture scalability.
- **Advanced Embedding Techniques:** Implement Word2Vec or GloVe.
- **Data Augmentation:** Introduce robust augmentation methods to improve adaptability.
- **Neuro-symbolic Integration Advances:** Explore deeper integration to enhance reasoning capabilities.

## Contributions

- Development of a GNN-augmented architecture with attention mechanisms.
- Implementation of neuro-symbolic integration for logical reasoning enhancement.
- Creation of diverse synthetic datasets for model evaluation.

Through ongoing improvements and methodology refinement, this work aims to significantly advance symbolic reasoning capabilities within artificial intelligence.
