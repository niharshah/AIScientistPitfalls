# Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) Framework

Welcome to the Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) Framework! This repository contains a Hybrid Neural-Symbolic Framework designed to tackle the complexities of SPR tasks. The goal of SPR is to determine whether a sequence of abstract symbols satisfies a hidden target ruleâ€”a challenge with significant applications in areas such as automated theorem proving and symbolic regression.

## Overview

The solution leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) integrated with attention mechanisms to dynamically prioritize significant graph attributes, facilitating a balanced learning process from both symbolic and neural perspectives. The framework uses models such as Diffusion Convolutional Neural Networks (DGCNN), GraphSAGE, and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to address the relational dependencies present in symbolic sequences.

## Features

- **Hybrid Neural-Symbolic Approach**: Balances both symbolic and neural components to improve interpretability and accuracy.
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Utilizes DGCNN, GraphSAGE, and GAT models enhanced with attention mechanisms.
- **Synthetic Dataset Generation**: Includes datasets that span a variety of rule complexities and relational dependencies.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Assesses performance using train and test accuracies, with insights into the robustness and limitations of the framework.

## Installation

Clone this repository to get started:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/synthetic-polyrule-reasoning.git
```

Navigate into the repository:
```bash
cd synthetic-polyrule-reasoning
```

Install the required dependencies.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To train and evaluate the model, run:

```bash
python train_and_evaluate.py
```

This will perform the training on synthetic datasets and evaluate the model's accuracy against hidden target rules.

## Results

Our framework achieves a train accuracy of 69.15% and a test accuracy of 69.00%, slightly below the benchmark of 70%. These results demonstrate the potential of graph-based hybrid models for symbolic pattern recognition, with room for further improvements in model sophistication and dataset diversity.

## Future Work

- **Model Improvement**: Explore more sophisticated GNN architectures and enhanced attention mechanisms.
- **Dataset Expansion**: Incorporate real-world data and expand synthetic dataset diversity.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Apply advanced hyperparameter optimization methods and regularization techniques.
