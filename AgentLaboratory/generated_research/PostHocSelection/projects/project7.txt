Outlined in the following text is the research plan that the machine learning engineer was tasked with building: Title: A Hybrid Neural–Symbolic Model for Robust SPR Classification

Objective:
Develop a robust algorithm for Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) by creating a **Hybrid Neural-Symbolic Framework** that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to interpret complex sequences and determine if they satisfy a hidden target rule. The goal is to address the challenge of capturing intricate relationships and dependencies among symbolic attributes like shape, color, parity, and order.

Plan Outline:
1.  **Dataset Design:**
    * Synthesize datasets that encompass a wide spectrum of rule complexities to validate the proposed methodology.
    * Use these datasets to rigorously test the model's ability to generalize across different symbolic rule scenarios.
    * Partition the dataset into training and test splits to evaluate the model's performance and robustness.

2.  **Model Architecture:**
    * **Graph Neural Network (GNN) Backbone:** Use GNNs to process the symbolic sequences, as they are well-suited for capturing intricate relational dependencies.
    * **Hybrid Framework:** Integrate multiple GNN models, such as **Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN), GraphSAGE, and Graph Attention Networks (GAT)**, to create a robust framework.
    * **Attention Mechanisms:** Incorporate attention mechanisms to enable the model to dynamically prioritize significant graph attributes, balancing learning from both symbolic and neural components.

3.  **Training Procedure:**
    * Train the model to achieve high accuracy in determining whether an L-token sequence satisfies a given rule.
    * Implement regularization methods, such as **dropout and batch normalization**, to mitigate overfitting and improve accuracy.
    * Use a hyperparameter optimization technique to find the best configuration for the GNN models.

4.  **Experiment Details:**
    * **Evaluation Metrics:** Report the **train accuracy** and **test accuracy** to provide a clear measure of the model's performance.
    * **Baseline Comparisons:** Compare the model's performance to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline of 70% to validate its effectiveness.
    * **Robustness Tests:** Evaluate the model's robustness and adaptability by testing it on datasets with varying symbolic attributes and relational dependencies.

5.  **Expected Outcomes and Innovations:**
    * A hybrid neural-symbolic framework that effectively leverages GNNs to address the challenges of SPR.
    * The model is expected to achieve a test accuracy near or above the SOTA benchmark of 70%, providing a foundation for future advancements.
    * Insights into the robustness and limitations of the hybrid approach will be gained, paving the way for further exploration of sophisticated models and expanded dataset diversity.
