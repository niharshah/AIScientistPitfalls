Outlined in the following text is the research plan that the machine learning engineer was tasked with building: Title: A Hybrid Neural–Symbolic Model for Robust SPR Classification

Objective:
Propose a novel framework that integrates a **multi-modal transformer encoder** with a **differentiable symbolic reasoning module** to address Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR). The goal is to both classify sequences based on complex hidden poly-factor rules and to extract human-interpretable symbolic predicates. The framework should handle tokens with multiple attributes like shape, color, and texture.

Plan Outline:
1.  **Dataset Design:**
    * Synthesize a dataset where each instance is a sequence of tokens with shape, color, and texture.
    * The dataset will be generated based on a variety of complex hidden poly-factor rules.
    * Use a rigorous experimental protocol to evaluate both predictive performance and the quality of the extracted symbolic predicates.

2.  **Model Architecture:**
    * **A. Multi-modal Transformer Encoder:**
        * Use a transformer-based network with **modality-specific embeddings** to effectively fuse shape, color, and texture information.
        * Separate embedding layers will be used for each token attribute, which are then combined with **positional encodings** and processed by **multi-head self-attention**.
    * **B. Differentiable Symbolic Reasoning Module:**
        * Integrate a soft logic layer with an **L1 sparsity regularization penalty** to promote the extraction of sparse, clear rules that mirror the underlying task constraints.
        * This module will output soft predicate activations to ensure interpretability.
    * **C. End-to-End System Optimization:**
        * Train the complete system jointly to ensure both high classification accuracy and rule interpretability.
        * The final prediction will be a binary classification (accept vs. reject).

3.  **Training Procedure:**
    * **Loss:** Use a total loss function that is a sum of a **binary cross-entropy loss** for classification and the **L1 sparsity loss** to encourage the selection of only the most relevant symbolic features.
    * **Optimization:** Use an end-to-end optimization problem to update the model parameters.
    * **Training Strategy:** The training process should show robust convergence, with the training loss consistently decreasing over epochs.

4.  **Experiment Details:**
    * **Evaluation Metrics:** Report the final test accuracy.
    * **Baseline Comparisons:** Compare the proposed model's performance to an established baseline to demonstrate significant improvement.
    * **Future Work:** Extend the framework to more complex rule sets and enhance the modality fusion strategies. Refine the transformer architecture to better capture temporal dependencies.

5.  **Expected Outcomes and Innovations:**
    * A combined **neural-symbolic system** that accurately classifies sequences and provides interpretable intermediate representations reflecting the underlying predicates.
    * A model that effectively **bridges the gap** between sub-symbolic learning and structured rule extraction.
    * Empirical validation showing the model's test accuracy substantially outperforms the baseline, confirming the efficacy of the integrated approach.

=== Starting Training Experiment for SPR Task ===
This experiment trains a multi-modal transformer model that fuses shape, color, and texture embeddings with positional encoding.
It evaluates two aspects:
  1. SPR classification performance (binary decision) based on the hidden rules.
  2. Extraction of interpretable soft symbolic predicates via a symbolic reasoning head.
The training loss is computed as the sum of binary cross-entropy loss and an L1 sparsity loss on the symbolic outputs.

Epoch 1: Training Loss = 0.1612, Dev Accuracy = 94.80%
Epoch 2: Training Loss = 0.1504, Dev Accuracy = 94.80%
Epoch 3: Training Loss = 0.1494, Dev Accuracy = 94.80%
Epoch 4: Training Loss = 0.1156, Dev Accuracy = 94.80%
Epoch 5: Training Loss = 0.0816, Dev Accuracy = 94.60%

=== Test Evaluation ===
This evaluation measures the overall SPR classification performance on unseen test data.
Predictions are derived by applying a threshold (0.5) to the sigmoid-transformed outputs of the classifier head.

Test Accuracy: 94.20%  (SPR classification performance on unseen data)
