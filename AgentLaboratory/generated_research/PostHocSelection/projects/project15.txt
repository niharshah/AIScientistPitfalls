Outlined in the following text is the research plan that the machine learning engineer was tasked with building: Title: A Hybrid Neural–Symbolic Model for Robust SPR Classification

Objective:
Develop a simple, yet innovative, baseline method for **Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR)** by employing a **bag-of-tokens representation** and a **logistic regression classifier**. The objective is to establish a rigorous and transparent benchmark for future research into more sophisticated neuro-symbolic models, and to demonstrate that a straightforward approach can achieve substantial performance improvements over traditional methods.


Plan Outline:
1.  **Dataset Design:**
    * Utilize the **SPR BENCH dataset** consisting of structured symbolic sequences.
    * Partition the dataset into **training, development, and test sets** to ensure unbiased evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.
    * Apply a custom tokenization procedure using a **Count Vectorizer** to accurately capture the symbolic structure of the sequences, transforming them into sparse vector representations.

2.  **Model Architecture:**
    * **Feature Extraction:** Transform each input sequence into a **high-dimensional bag-of-tokens representation**, which serves as the input feature vector.
    * **Classifier:** Feed the extracted feature vector into a **logistic regression classifier**, defined as $f(x)=\sigma(Wx+b)$, where $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function.
    * **Model Parameters:** The model's learnable parameters are the weight matrix **W** and the bias vector **b**.

3.  **Training Procedure:**
    * **Loss Function:** Train the classifier by minimizing the **cross-entropy loss**, defined as $L=-\sum_{i=1}^{N}[y_{i}log(\hat{y}_{i})]$.
    * **Optimization:** Use standard numerical libraries and configure the model with a maximum of **1000 iterations**.
    * **Reproducibility:** Ensure reproducibility across all runs by using a **fixed random seed**.

4.  **Experiment Details:**
    * **Performance Metrics:** Report the **accuracy** on the training, development, and test sets.
    * **Quantitative Analysis:** Conduct a detailed quantitative analysis, including a comparison to a baseline of 70.0% accuracy, representing an improvement of approximately 7.7 percentage points.
    * **Visual Diagnostics:** Complement the quantitative assessment with visual tools, such as a **confusion matrix** and **bar plots**, to analyze misclassification patterns and confirm the stability of the learned patterns.
    * **Baseline Comparisons:** Compare this approach to more complex methods to highlight the trade-offs between model complexity and interpretability.

5.  **Expected Outcomes and Innovations:**
    * Establish a robust and interpretable baseline for symbolic pattern recognition.
    * Demonstrate that careful feature engineering, particularly through a custom tokenization process, is crucial for preserving symbolic structure and improving model performance.
    * Lay the groundwork for future research by identifying the limitations of this approach (e.g., its inability to capture sequential dependencies) and outlining potential enhancements, such as integrating explicit rule extraction or non-linear models.
