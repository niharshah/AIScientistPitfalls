Outlined in the following text is the research plan that the machine learning engineer was tasked with building: Title: A Hybrid Neural–Symbolic Model for Robust SPR Classification

Objective:
Develop a simple yet innovative baseline method for **Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR)** by employing a **bag-of-tokens representation** and a **logistic regression classifier**. The objective is to establish a transparent benchmark that can be used to evaluate more complex, future neuro-symbolic models, and to demonstrate that a straightforward approach can achieve competitive performance.

Plan Outline:
1.  **Dataset Design:**
    * Use a pre-divided dataset with splits for **training, development, and testing**.
    * The sequences will consist of symbolic tokens.
    * Process the sequences using a **Count Vectorizer** with a custom token pattern to transform them into sparse vector representations, accurately preserving the symbolic structure.

2.  **Model Architecture:**
    * **Feature Extraction:** The core feature representation will be a **bag-of-tokens model** created by the Count Vectorizer, which captures the frequency of each symbol within a sequence.
    * **Classification Module:** A **logistic regression model** will be used as the classifier, with its hypothesis function defined as $h_{\theta}(x)=\sigma(\theta^{T}x)$.

3.  **Training Procedure:**
    * **Loss:** Train the model by minimizing the **cross-entropy loss**.
    * **Optimization:** Employ a gradient descent-based optimizer with a maximum of **200 iterations** to ensure model convergence.
    * **Training Strategy:** Train the model on the training set, and evaluate its generalization capabilities on the development and test sets.

4.  **Experiment Details:**
    * **Evaluation Metrics:** Report the **accuracy** on all three dataset splits. Additionally, analyze performance using **confusion matrices** to identify systematic misclassifications.
    * **Baseline Comparisons:** Compare the model's performance to other state-of-the-art models for similar tasks, emphasizing the trade-off between simplicity and generalization.
    * **Robustness Tests:** Conduct **ablation studies** to understand the impact of minor modifications to the token pattern and iteration count on overall performance.

5.  **Expected Outcomes and Innovations:**
    * Establish a **clear baseline performance** for SPR tasks using a simple, interpretable model.
    * Quantify the **generalization gap** between training and test performance, demonstrating the limitations of frequency-based representations for complex symbolic tasks.
    * Provide a **roadmap for future research**, suggesting avenues for improvement such as the integration of Transformer architectures, neuro-symbolic fusion, or alternative feature representations like n-grams and positional encoding.
