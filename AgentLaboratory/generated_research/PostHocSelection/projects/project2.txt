Outlined in the following text is the research plan that the machine learning engineer was tasked with building: Title: A Hybrid Neural–Symbolic Model for Robust SPR Classification

Objective:
Develop a baseline method for symbolic pattern recognition that leverages a bag-of-tokens representation and a logistic regression classifier to accurately classify structured symbolic data. The method should serve as a foundation for future, more advanced neuro-symbolic architectures.

Plan Outline:
1.  **Dataset Preparation and Preprocessing**:
    * Utilize the **SPR BENCH dataset**, which consists of structured symbolic sequences paired with binary labels.
    * Divide the dataset into three distinct subsets: **Training, Development, and Test** to ensure unbiased evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.
    * Apply a custom tokenization procedure using the regular expression pattern `(?u)\S+` to accurately preserve all symbolic tokens, including special symbols like ♢, □, •, and ∆.

2.  **Model Architecture**:
    * **Feature Extraction**: Transform each input sequence into a **high-dimensional bag-of-tokens representation**, $\phi(X)$. This is achieved by using a Count Vectorizer with a custom token pattern to count the frequency of each token in the sequence.
    * **Classifier**: Feed the extracted bag-of-tokens feature vector into a **logistic regression classifier**, defined mathematically as $f(x)=\sigma(Wx+b)$, where $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function.
    * **Model Parameters**: The model's learnable parameters are the weight matrix **W** and the bias vector **b**.

3.  **Training Procedure**:
    * **Loss Function**: Train the classifier by minimizing the **cross-entropy loss**, $L=-\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}[y^{(i)}log\hat{y}^{(i)}+(1-y^{(i)})log(1-\hat{y}^{(i)})]$. This quantifies the discrepancy between predicted probabilities and true labels.
    * **Optimization**: Use standard numerical libraries and configure the model with a maximum of **1000 iterations**.
    * **Reproducibility**: Ensure reproducibility across all runs by using a **fixed random seed of 42**.
    * **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model on the training, development, and test splits, reporting accuracy as the primary metric.

4.  **Experimental Details**:
    * **Performance Metrics**: Report the **accuracy** on the training, development, and test sets.
    * **Quantitative Analysis**: Conduct a detailed quantitative analysis, including a comparison to a baseline of 70.0% accuracy, representing an approximate 7.7 percentage point improvement.
    * **Visual Diagnostics**: Complement the quantitative assessment with visual tools, such as bar plots showing training and development accuracies and a confusion matrix to analyze misclassification patterns.
    * **Baseline Comparisons**: Compare this approach to more complex methods from the literature, such as Transformer-based models and neuro-symbolic architectures, highlighting the trade-offs between model complexity and interpretability.

5.  **Expected Outcomes and Innovations**:
    * Establish a robust and interpretable baseline for symbolic pattern recognition by showing that a simple bag-of-tokens model with a linear classifier can achieve competitive performance.
    * Demonstrate that careful feature engineering, particularly through a custom tokenization process, is crucial for preserving symbolic structure and improving model performance.
    * Lay the groundwork for future research by identifying the limitations of this approach (e.g., its inability to capture sequential dependencies) and outlining potential enhancements, such as integrating explicit rule extraction or non-linear models.

By executing this plan, we aim to validate the efficacy of a straightforward, transparent methodology in a complex domain and provide a clear roadmap for subsequent research in neuro-symbolic AI.
