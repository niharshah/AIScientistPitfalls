Outlined in the following text is the research plan that the machine learning engineer was tasked with building: Title: A Hybrid Neuralâ€“Symbolic Model for Robust SPR Classification

Objective:
Develop a robust baseline method for symbolic pattern recognition by combining a bag-of-tokens representation with a logistic regression classifier to accurately classify structured symbolic data. The method should serve as a foundation for future, more advanced neuro-symbolic architectures and achieve significant performance improvements over traditional approaches.

Plan Outline:
1.  **Dataset Preparation and Preprocessing**:
    * Utilize the **SPR BENCH dataset**, which consists of structured symbolic sequences paired with binary labels.
    * Divide the dataset into three distinct subsets: **Training, Development, and Test** to ensure unbiased evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.
    * Apply a custom tokenization procedure using a **Count Vectorizer** with a token pattern that accurately preserves symbolic structure.

2.  **Model Architecture**:
    * **Feature Extraction**: Transform each input sequence into a **high-dimensional bag-of-tokens representation**, which serves as the input feature vector.
    * **Classifier**: Feed the extracted feature vector into a **logistic regression classifier**, defined as $f(x)=\sigma(Wx+b)$, where $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function.
    * **Model Parameters**: The model's learnable parameters are the weight matrix **W** and the bias vector **b**.

3.  **Training Procedure**:
    * **Loss Function**: Train the classifier by minimizing the **cross-entropy loss**, $L=-\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}[y^{(i)}log\hat{y}^{(i)}+(1-y^{(i)})log(1-\hat{y}^{(i)})]$.
    * **Optimization**: Use standard numerical libraries and configure the model with a maximum of **1000 iterations**.
    * **Reproducibility**: Ensure reproducibility across all runs by using a **fixed random seed**.

4.  **Experiment Details**:
    * **Performance Metrics**: Report the **accuracy** on the training, development, and test sets.
    * **Quantitative Analysis**: Conduct a detailed quantitative analysis, including a comparison to a baseline of 70.0% accuracy, representing an approximate 7.7 percentage point improvement.
    * **Visual Diagnostics**: Complement the quantitative assessment with visual tools, such as **bar plots** showing training and development accuracies and a **confusion matrix** to analyze misclassification patterns.
    * **Baseline Comparisons**: Compare this approach to more complex methods from the literature, such as Transformer-based models and neuro-symbolic architectures, highlighting the trade-offs between model complexity and interpretability.

5.  **Expected Outcomes and Innovations**:
    * Establish a robust and interpretable baseline for symbolic pattern recognition by showing that a simple bag-of-tokens model with a linear classifier can achieve competitive performance.
    * Demonstrate that careful feature engineering, particularly through a custom tokenization process, is crucial for preserving symbolic structure and improving model performance.
    * Lay the groundwork for future research by identifying the limitations of this approach (e.g., its inability to capture sequential dependencies) and outlining potential enhancements, such as integrating explicit rule extraction or non-linear models.

X_test = [x["sequence"] for x in test_data]
y_test = [int(x["label"]) for x in test_data]

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Note on Fix:
# The original error "empty vocabulary; perhaps the documents only contain stop words"
# might be occurring if each token in the sequence is a single character. The default
# token_pattern in CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer (r"(?u)\b\w\w+\b") ignores
# single-character tokens, leading to an empty vocabulary.
#
# The fix below is to adjust the token_pattern to include single-character tokens.

The classifier is trained in a similar manner to decide if the L-token symbolic sequence meets the concealed target rule. We expect this approach to potentially capture more nuanced patterns, possibly leading to improved accuracy on both dev and test splits.
