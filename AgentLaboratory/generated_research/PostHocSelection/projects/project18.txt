Outlined in the following text is the research plan that the machine learning engineer was tasked with building: Title: A Hybrid Neuralâ€“Symbolic Model for Robust SPR Classification

Objective: Propose a novel framework that integrates a **multi-modal transformer encoder** with a **differentiable symbolic reasoning module** to address the challenging task of Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR). The objective is to both classify sequences based on complex hidden poly-factor rules and to extract human-interpretable symbolic predicates.

Plan Outline:
1.  **Dataset Design:**
    * Synthesize a dataset where each instance is a sequence of tokens with shape, color, and texture attributes.
    * The dataset will be generated based on a variety of complex hidden poly-factor rules.
    * Partition the dataset into **training, development, and test sets** to ensure robust evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.

2.  **Model Architecture:**
    * **A. Multi-modal Transformer Encoder:**
        * Use a transformer-based network with **modality-specific embeddings** to effectively fuse shape, color, and texture information.
        * Separate embedding layers will be used for each token attribute, which are then combined with **positional encodings** and processed by **multi-head self-attention**.
    * **B. Differentiable Symbolic Reasoning Module:**
        * Integrate a soft logic layer with an **L1 sparsity regularization penalty** to promote the extraction of sparse, clear rules that mirror the underlying task constraints.
        * This module will output soft predicate activations to ensure interpretability.
    * **C. Decision Layer:**
        * The final prediction will be a binary classification (**accept vs. reject**) from the output of the combined neural and symbolic modules.

3.  **Training Procedure:**
    * **Loss:** Use a total loss function that is a sum of a **binary cross-entropy loss** for classification and the **L1 sparsity loss** to encourage the selection of only the most relevant symbolic features.
    * **Optimization:** Train the complete system jointly using a suitable optimizer to update the model parameters.
    * **Training Strategy:** The training process will be a single end-to-end optimization problem designed for high classification accuracy and rule interpretability.

4.  **Experiment Details:**
    * **Evaluation Metrics:** Report the final **test accuracy**.
    * **Baseline Comparisons:** Compare the proposed model's performance to an established baseline to demonstrate significant improvement.
    * **Future Work:** Extend the framework to more complex rule sets and enhance the modality fusion strategies.

5.  **Expected Outcomes and Innovations:**
    * A combined **neural-symbolic system** that accurately classifies sequences and provides interpretable intermediate representations reflective of the underlying predicates.
    * A model that effectively **bridges the gap** between sub-symbolic learning and structured rule extraction.
    * Empirical validation showing the model's test accuracy substantially outperforms the baseline, confirming the efficacy of the integrated approach.
