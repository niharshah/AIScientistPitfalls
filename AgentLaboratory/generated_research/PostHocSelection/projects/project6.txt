Outlined in the following text is the research plan that the machine learning engineer was tasked with building: Title: A Hybrid Neural–Symbolic Model for Robust SPR Classification

Objective:
Develop a robust baseline method for symbolic pattern recognition by combining a bag-of-tokens representation with a logistic regression classifier to accurately classify structured symbolic data, aiming to establish a foundational benchmark for future research in neuro-symbolic architectures.

Plan Outline:
1.  **Dataset Preparation and Preprocessing:**
    * Utilize the **SPR BENCH dataset** consisting of structured symbolic sequences.
    * Partition the dataset into **training, development, and test sets** for unbiased evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.
    * Tokenize the sequences using a custom **Count Vectorizer** with a regular expression pattern to accurately preserve symbolic structure.

2.  **Model Architecture:**
    * **Feature Extraction:** Convert each symbolic sequence into a **high-dimensional bag-of-tokens representation**, which serves as the input feature vector.
    * **Classifier:** Employ a **logistic regression classifier** to determine if a sequence adheres to a hidden poly-factor rule. The model is defined as $f(x)=\sigma(Wx+b)$, where $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function.
    * **Parameters:** The model's learnable parameters are the weight matrix **W** and the bias vector **b**.

3.  **Training Procedure:**
    * **Loss Function:** Use the **cross-entropy loss function** to measure the difference between the model's predictions and the true labels, minimizing it during training.
    * **Optimization:** Train the model using standard numerical libraries with a maximum of **1000 iterations**.
    * **Reproducibility:** Ensure reproducibility by setting a **fixed random seed**.

4.  **Experiment Details:**
    * **Performance Metrics:** Report the **accuracy** on the training, development, and test sets.
    * **Quantitative Analysis:** Conduct a detailed quantitative analysis, including a comparison of the model's performance against a baseline of 70.0% accuracy.
    * **Visual Diagnostics:** Use visual tools such as a **confusion matrix** and **bar plots** to analyze misclassification patterns and confirm the stability of the learned patterns.
    * **Evaluation:** Compare the model's performance with more complex methods from the literature to highlight trade-offs between complexity and interpretability.

5.  **Expected Outcomes and Innovations:**
    * Establish a robust and interpretable baseline for SPR by demonstrating that a straightforward model can achieve competitive performance.
    * Show that careful feature engineering, specifically through custom tokenization, is crucial for preserving symbolic structure and improving model performance.
    * Lay the groundwork for future research by identifying the limitations of this approach and outlining potential enhancements, such as integrating explicit rule extraction or using non-linear models.
