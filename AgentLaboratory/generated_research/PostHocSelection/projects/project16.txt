Outlined in the following text is the research plan that the machine learning engineer was tasked with building: Title: A Hybrid Neuralâ€“Symbolic Model for Robust SPR Classification

Objective: Develop a hybrid Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR) algorithm that integrates **Graph Wavelet Neural Networks (GWNNs)** and **neuro-symbolic reasoning** to enhance the performance of SPR tasks. The model will leverage graph-based data representations to capture the intricate relationships and attributes within symbolic sequences and aims to surpass traditional methods.

Plan Outline:
1.  **Dataset Design:**
    * Utilize a synthetic dataset to emulate the complex structure of symbolic sequences.
    * The dataset will contain varying rules and patterns to challenge the model's ability to generalize.
    * Partition the dataset into training, development, and test sets to ensure rigorous evaluation.

2.  **Model Architecture:**
    * **A. GWNN Backbone**:
        * Convert symbolic sequences into graph formats where symbols are nodes and edges illustrate dependencies.
        * Employ **Graph Wavelet Neural Networks** to model these relationships and extract features.
    * **B. Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Module**:
        * Integrate a module to enhance the model's capacity to understand and interpret symbolic data.
    * **C. Classification Layer**:
        * A final layer will be used to classify the sequences based on the learned features and relationships.

3.  **Training Procedure:**
    * **Loss**: Use a loss function that is appropriate for sequence analysis and classification.
    * **Optimization**: Employ an optimizer to minimize the loss function and update model parameters.
    * **Training Strategy**: Train the model with a focus on capturing intricate dependencies and ensuring adaptability to unseen symbolic patterns.

4.  **Experiment Details:**
    * **Evaluation Metrics**: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as **accuracy, precision, and recall** to provide a comprehensive understanding.
    * **Baseline Comparisons**: Compare the model's performance to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks.
    * **Robustness Tests**: Test the model on a wide range of symbolic complexities and data augmentations to evaluate its generalizability.

5.  **Expected Outcomes and Innovations:**
    * A hybrid SPR algorithm that effectively integrates GWNNs and neuro-symbolic reasoning.
    * A model that can successfully navigate the ambiguity and complexity of symbolic relationships.
    * Insights into how this hybrid approach can contribute to broader advancements in fields like natural language processing and bioinformatics.
