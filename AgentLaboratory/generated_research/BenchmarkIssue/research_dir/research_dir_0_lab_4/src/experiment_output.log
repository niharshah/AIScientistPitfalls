================ Experiment on dataset EWERV ================
This experiment trains a logistic regression model to decide if a given symbolic sequence satisfies a hidden target rule.
It uses TF-IDF features extracted directly from the sequences. It then tunes on the dev split and finally reports accuracy on the test split.
Results for dataset EWERV:
 - Training Accuracy: 82.10%
 - Dev Accuracy: 80.20%
 - Test Accuracy: 80.50%

================ Experiment on dataset URCJF ================
