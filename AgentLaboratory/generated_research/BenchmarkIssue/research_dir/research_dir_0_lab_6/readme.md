# Sequence Pattern Recognition (SPR) Task: Algorithm Development

This repository contains the implementation of a hybrid model for the Sequence Pattern Recognition (SPR) task, integrating graph-based representation, Bayesian networks, and fuzzy neural networks. The model aims to determine whether an \(L\)-token sequence satisfies a hidden rule, a significant challenge in anomaly detection, data mining, and automated sequence labeling.

## Abstract

The SPR task involves the identification of patterns within symbolic sequence data, where interdependencies among tokens are often complex and affected by noise. This repository introduces an advanced solution, leveraging attributed relational graphs for sequence representation, Bayesian networks for probabilistic inference, and fuzzy neural networks to address ambiguity in feature interpretation. Our hybrid model, validated on synthetic datasets, demonstrates improved accuracy over existing benchmarks, achieving up to 89\% accuracy in some cases.

## Methodology

1. **Graph-Based Representation**: 
   - Sequences are transformed into attributed relational graphs, preserving geometric and topological information necessary for robust pattern recognition.
   
2. **Bayesian Networks**:
   - Used to encode probabilistic dependencies within graphs, excelling in handling uncertainty and variability in data.

3. **Fuzzy Neural Networks**:
   - Enhance classification by handling symbolic sequence ambiguity, using fuzzy logic principles.

4. **Algorithm Selection Techniques**:
   - Dynamically choose components to optimize performance based on dataset characteristics.

## Experimental Setup

- **Datasets**: Synthetic datasets (e.g., DFWZN, JWAEU, GURSG, QAVBE, IJSJF) mimicking real-world SPR challenges were used for validation.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Primary metric is accuracy, supported by confusion matrices for detailed performance insights.
- **Implementation**: Utilizes Gaussian Naive Bayes for Bayesian networks and grid search for hyperparameter optimization.

## Results

- Achieved varying accuracy across datasets with a maximum of 89% on DFWZN and IJSJF.
- Highlighted strengths in structured datasets but identified performance gaps when dealing with noisy data.

## Next Steps

- Integration of advanced preprocessing techniques such as noise reduction and feature extraction.
- Enhancement of fuzzy neural network components with dropout layers and convolutional architectures to improve performance on noisy datasets.
