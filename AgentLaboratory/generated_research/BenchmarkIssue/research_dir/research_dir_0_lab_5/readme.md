# Emergent Symbolic Pattern Recognition with Baseline Models

This repository contains the code, experimental setup, and full research report for our study on emergent symbolic pattern recognition (SPR) using a simple yet effective baseline model. Our approach leverages a TF–IDF representation paired with logistic regression to automatically extract implicit symbolic rules from sequential data. The repository is intended for researchers and practitioners interested in interpretable models that balance performance and transparency when addressing heterogeneous datasets.

## Overview

Symbolic pattern recognition (SPR) seeks to uncover latent symbolic rules from data sequences. In our work, we demonstrate that even a straightforward, interpretable baseline—combining TF–IDF vectorization with a logistic regression classifier—can yield competitive performance on tasks with explicit symbolic patterns, while also highlighting the challenges posed by noisy or ambiguous rule structures. Our experiments are conducted on four benchmark datasets:

- **SFRFG**
- **IJSJF**
- **GURSG**
- **TEXHE**

Key performance highlights include:
- SFRFG: Test Accuracy ≈ 94.70%
- IJSJF: Test Accuracy ≈ 71.30%
- GURSG: Test Accuracy ≈ 94.40%
- TEXHE: Test Accuracy ≈ 76.40%

These results underscore a dichotomy between datasets in which symbolic patterns are overt versus those where the rules are more subtle.

## Methodology

Our approach consists of two main components:

1. **Feature Extraction with TF–IDF:**  
   - Converts an input sequence x into a high-dimensional vector representation.
   - Limited to a vocabulary size of 5000 tokens for computational efficiency.

2. **Logistic Regression Classifier:**  
   - Learns the conditional probability P(y|x) using a softmax formulation:
     
     P(y|x) = exp{w_yᵀ · φ(x)} / Σₖ exp{wₖᵀ · φ(x)}
     
   - Optimizes the model parameters by minimizing the cross-entropy loss:
     
     L = - (1/n) Σᵢ Σₖ I[yᵢ = k] · log P(y=k|xᵢ)

This combination provides both high interpretability and competitive accuracy on datasets with clear symbolic signals while highlighting areas where more sophisticated neurosymbolic techniques could further improve performance (especially for datasets with ambiguous patterns).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip
- Recommended Python packages:
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - pandas

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Experiments

1. **Data Preparation:**  
   Ensure that the benchmark datasets (SFRFG, IJSJF, GURSG, TEXHE) are placed in the `/data` directory or follow instructions provided in the data README.

2. **Feature Extraction & Training:**  
   Run the main training script that handles:
   - TF–IDF vectorization of the input sequences.
   - Logistic regression training with cross-entropy minimization.
   - Hyperparameter settings (e.g., maximum of 1000 iterations, default regularization parameters).

   Example command:

   ```bash
   python code/train_model.py --dataset SFRFG --vocab_size 5000
   ```

3. **Evaluation:**  
   After training, the script will output performance metrics including:
   - Development and test accuracies.
   - Normalized error metric defined as:
     
     ε = (1/n) Σᵢ |yᵢ − ŷᵢ|
     
   - Additional figures such as confusion matrices.

4. **Reproducibility:**  
   The experiments are designed to be reproducible over multiple random seeds. Configuration options are available in the experiment scripts under `/experiments`.

## Experimental Results

The repository includes example outputs and plots that confirm the following performance trends:
- High accuracies (above 94%) on benchmarks such as SFRFG and GURSG indicate that the baseline model effectively captures explicit symbolic patterns.
- Lower accuracies on IJSJF and TEXHE (approximately 71–76%) point to the need for enhanced feature representations or integration with neurosymbolic techniques.

For a complete quantitative analysis and discussion, please refer to the research report (`report.tex` or the compiled PDF).

## Future Work

Based on our findings, several avenues for future research are highlighted:
- **Enhanced Feature Extraction:**  
  Investigate more advanced vectorization methods (e.g., contextual embeddings).

- **Hybrid Models:**  
  Combine explicit symbolic reasoning with deep neural architectures for handling subtle or noisy patterns.

- **Dynamic Model Complexity:**  
  Explore meta-learning or adaptive regularization techniques that automatically adjust the model based on data characteristics.

These enhancements aim to further improve both performance and interpretability in complex real-world SPR tasks.
