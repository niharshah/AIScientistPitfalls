Train samples: 20000
Dev samples: 5000
Test samples: 10000
Example from train set: {'id': 'SPR_train_0', 'sequence': '●y ●g ●r ■r ▲y ▲g', 'label': 0}

Training experiment: Train a Logistic Regression model on SPR_BENCH training split.

Dev experiment: Evaluating model on development set using Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA).
Dev SWA (Shape-Weighted Accuracy): 0.5382

Test experiment: Evaluating model on test set using Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA).
Test SWA (Shape-Weighted Accuracy): 0.5411
SUCCESS: The model did not achieve 0% accuracy. The symbolic pattern recognition experiment appears to be running correctly.

Figure 1: Plotting confusion matrix for the test set predictions. This figure shows how the predicted class labels compare with the true labels.

Figure 2: Plotting scatter plot of unique shape count versus correctness for the test set. 
This figure visualizes the relationship between the symbolic abstraction (unique shape count) and prediction accuracy.

All experiments completed. Figures 'Figure_1.png' and 'Figure_2.png' have been saved. The code has demonstrated a complete pipeline from feature extraction, training a logistic regression classifier, evaluating using SWA, and visualization of results.
