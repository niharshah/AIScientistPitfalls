# --- Begin experiment code ---

# --- Prepare feature extraction for each sample ---
# For each sequence we extract three features:
#   f1: Count of unique shape types (first character of each token)
#   f2: Count of unique color types (second character if token length > 1)
#   f3: Total number of tokens in the sequence
#
# We treat these as indicative of the abstract structure. This is in line with the
# idea that emergent symbolic mechanisms (e.g. counting unique abstractions) are useful.
# Note: We explicitly avoid defining functions and perform computations inline.
