Starting training of Logistic Regression classifier on training data...
Training completed.

Experiment 1: Evaluating performance on the Development (Dev) split.
This experiment aims to show both the raw accuracy and the Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) on the Dev set.
Dev Raw Accuracy: 0.5398
Dev Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA): 0.5382
Figure_1.png has been saved, showing the confusion matrix for the Dev set.

Experiment 2: Evaluating performance on the Test split.
This experiment is designed to display the generalization of our model on unseen data using the Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) metric.
Test Raw Accuracy: 0.5425
Test Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA): 0.5411
Figure_2.png has been saved, showing a scatter plot of shape complexity vs token count for the Test set.

All experiments completed. The logistic regression classifier achieved non-zero accuracies on both Dev and Test splits.
