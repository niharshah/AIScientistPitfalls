# We will extract simple numeric features for our classifier:
#    Feature 1: shape_complexity (computed as the number of unique shape glyphs)
#    Feature 2: color_complexity (computed as the number of unique color glyphs)
#    Feature 3: token_count (number of tokens in the sequence)
# The label is assumed to be numeric (if not, it is converted to int).
