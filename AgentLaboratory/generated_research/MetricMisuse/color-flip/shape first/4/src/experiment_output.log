[Experiment 1] Training Full Neuro-Symbolic Hybrid Model with Predicate Extraction
This experiment shows the hybrid model's ability to infer the SPR rule using explicit predicate extraction. Figure_1.png displays the training loss curve and Figure_2.png shows the histogram of predicate activations (Dev set).
Epoch 1/1 - Loss: 0.8487

[Experiment 1] Evaluation on Dev Set:
Shape-Weighted Accuracy on Dev set: 0.5765

[Experiment 1] Evaluation on Test Set:
Shape-Weighted Accuracy on Test set: 0.5225

[Experiment 2] Training Ablation Model (Transformer Encoder with FC Layer Only)
This experiment trains a baseline model that omits explicit predicate extraction. Its performance is evaluated using the same SWA metric.
[Ablation] Epoch 1/1 - Loss: 0.7042

[Experiment 2] Evaluation on Dev Set:
Shape-Weighted Accuracy on Dev set (Ablation Model): 0.6118

[Experiment 2] Evaluation on Test Set:
Shape-Weighted Accuracy on Test set (Ablation Model): 0.6124

Both experiments achieved non-zero accuracy. The hybrid model's explicit predicate extraction provides interpretability with competitive performance compared to the ablation model.
