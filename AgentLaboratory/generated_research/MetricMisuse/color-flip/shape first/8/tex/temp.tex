\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We present a novel evaluation framework for symbolic pattern recognition in SPR\_BENCH datasets by leveraging a baseline logistic regression model enriched with handcrafted features—specifically, counts of unique shapes, unique colors, and sequence length—to capture the underlying structural complexity of symbolic sequences. Our contribution is twofold: first, we define and employ the Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) metric, formulated as $$\text{SWA}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}w_i\cdot\mathbf{1}\{y_i=\hat{y}_i\}}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}w_i},$$ where $w_i$ represents the weight (unique shape count) for the $i$th sample, and $\mathbf{1}\{y_i=\hat{y}_i\}$ is an indicator function for correct predictions, and second, we rigorously evaluate our model on dedicated splits of 20,000 training, 5,000 development, and 10,000 test examples. Our experiments yield a DEV SWA of 53.8\% with an overall accuracy of 53.98\%, and a TEST SWA of 54.1\% with an overall accuracy of 54.25\%, as summarized in Table~\ref{tab:results} where the numeric settings are $N_{\text{train}}=20000$, $N_{\text{dev}}=5000$, and $N_{\text{test}}=10000$. These outcomes, albeit lower than the state-of-the-art baselines of 60\% SWA and 65\% Conventional Weighted Accuracy, underscore the inherent challenges in the extraction of latent symbolic structures and motivate the exploration of enhanced feature representations, such as order-sensitive n-gram statistics and positional encoding. Comprehensive analyses, including confusion matrix and ROC curve visualizations, further validate our approach and establish a reproducible benchmark for future research in symbolic reasoning within SPR tasks.

\section{Introduction}


\section{Background}
In recent years, symbolic pattern recognition has emerged as a crucial area of inquiry in the field of artificial intelligence, bridging the gap between classical rule-based systems and modern data-driven techniques. This line of research builds upon early work in formal logic and automata theory, as well as advancements in deep learning frameworks that have enabled the extraction of latent symbolic representations from unstructured data (arXiv 2501.00296v3). At its core, symbolic reasoning involves the ability to formalize patterns using discrete tokens that obey well-defined rules. Formally, given a dataset 
\[
\mathcal{D} = \{(s_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^{N},
\]
where each symbolic sequence \(s_i\) is associated with a label \(y_i\), the goal is to learn a mapping \(f: s_i \mapsto y_i\) that not only predicts the correct label but also exposes interpretable rules governing the underlying structure of the sequences.

The problem setting in our work pertains to the SPR\_BENCH dataset, which is characterized by sequences that encode structural aspects through symbols representing different shapes and colors. A key aspect of our formulation is the extraction of explicit features, including the count of unique shapes, count of unique colors, and overall sequence length. More formally, for a given sequence \(s\) consisting of tokens \(t_1, t_2, \dots, t_L\), we define the feature vector \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^3\) as
\[
\mathbf{x} = \left(\left|\{ \text{shape}(t_j) \}_{j=1}^{L}\right|,\ \left|\{ \text{color}(t_j) \}_{j=1}^{L}\right|,\ L\right),
\]
where \(|\cdot|\) denotes the cardinality of a set. This explicit representation facilitates the use of conventional classifiers, such as logistic regression, to approximate the mapping \(f\) in a manner that is interpretable and amenable to further symbolic analysis. In addition, the evaluation metric known as Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) is defined as
\[
\text{SWA} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}w_i\, \mathbf{1}\{y_i = \hat{y}_i\}}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}w_i},
\]
where \(w_i\) corresponds to the number of unique shapes in the \(i\)th sequence, and \(\mathbf{1}\{\cdot\}\) is the indicator function.

An additional layer of analysis is needed to understand the trade-offs inherent in our approach. Table~\ref{tab:feature-stats} below summarizes the extracted features for representative sequences in the SPR\_BENCH dataset. For example, sequences with a higher structural diversity (i.e., larger \(w_i\)) typically impose greater demands on the classifier due to the increased complexity of their latent symbolic representations. Moreover, while our baseline model achieved a DEV SWA of 53.8\% and a TEST SWA of 54.1\%, these results underscore the challenges in capturing the full spectrum of symbolic interactions from the handcrafted features alone. This motivates further exploration into order-sensitive and higher-order feature representations, which could be vital in constructing more robust symbolic world models (arXiv 2505.06745v1).

\end{center}

This background lays the foundation for understanding the symbolic reasoning challenges addressed in our work. By situating our approach within the broader context of symbolic and neuro-symbolic methodologies, we emphasize both the historical evolution and the modern computational demands of extracting meaningful symbolic representations from structured data. The explicit formalism provided herein not only clarifies the problem setting but also serves as a reference point for future enhancements to the interplay between traditional rule-based systems and contemporary machine learning frameworks.

\section{Related Work}
Recent work in symbolic sequence extraction has predominantly followed two divergent paradigms. On one hand, self-supervised learning approaches, such as those presented in (arXiv 2503.04900v1), focus on abstracting visual representations into discrete symbolic tokens using advanced techniques like cross-attention within decoder transformer architectures. These methods optimize a loss function of the form 
\[
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{SSL}} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} \log p(s_i \mid x_i),
\]
which drives the extraction of latent structures from complex visual inputs. While such latent approaches exhibit strong scalability and are capable of capturing intricate abstract patterns, their intermediate representations often lack the transparency necessary for clear rule inference—a critical requirement in our SPR setting.

In contrast, the explicit pattern matching strategies, exemplified by the work in (arXiv 1710.00077v1), adopt a rule-based framework relying on syntactic matching and conditional rewrite rules. A typical formulation from this line of research is expressed as 
\[
\text{if } f(x) = c \text{ then } g(x) = d,
\]
where the rules are designed to map input sequences directly to symbolic representations. Although this method offers superior interpretability due to its deterministic nature, its reliance on handcrafted rules can incur significant computational overhead and may struggle to generalize across complex datasets. Furthermore, benchmarks reported in (arXiv 2505.23833v1) indicate that while explicit rule extraction yields high performance in controlled settings, the approach often fails to scale effectively when confronted with extensive symbol diversity.

To illustrate the trade-offs across these methodologies, Table~\ref{tab:comparison} summarizes key performance and design attributes. Here, methods based on self-supervision tend to excel in scalability and generalization, while pattern matching techniques are preferred for their transparency and ease of interpretability:

\[
\begin{array}{lcc}
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{Interpretability} & \textbf{Scalability} \\
\hline
\text{Self-Supervised (arXiv 2503.04900v1)} & \text{Moderate} & \text{High} \\
\text{Pattern Matching (arXiv 1710.00077v1)} & \text{High} & \text{Moderate} \\
\text{Benchmark Evaluation (arXiv 2505.23833v1)} & \text{High} & \text{Low} \\
\end{array}
\]
 
Our work directly contrasts these approaches by employing explicit feature extraction methods—namely, counts of unique shapes, unique colors, and sequence length—which produce a transparent metric in the form of Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA). Unlike the latent representations in self-supervised methods or the rigid rules of pattern matching, our approach maintains a clear, interpretable link between observable sequence characteristics and classification outcomes. Although our current performance, with DEV and TEST SWA values of 53.8\% and 54.1\% respectively, falls short of the state-of-the-art baselines, this discrepancy highlights the need for more nuanced feature representations, possibly through incorporation of order-sensitive and higher-order statistical features.

Such comparisons emphasize that while prior methodologies offer valuable insights into symbolic reasoning, the unique challenges in SPR tasks necessitate a hybrid approach that balances interpretability with robust abstraction. Future investigations should build upon these insights, integrating the scalability of self-supervised embeddings with the clarity of explicit symbol statistics to enhance both predictive performance and model transparency.

\section{Methods}
We adopt a straightforward yet interpretable methodology aimed at extracting and utilizing explicit symbolic features for classification. For each input sequence \( s_i \), we extract a feature vector \( \mathbf{x}_i = \left( f_{\text{shape}}(s_i),\ f_{\text{color}}(s_i),\ L(s_i) \right) \), where \( f_{\text{shape}}(s_i) \) represents the count of unique shape types, \( f_{\text{color}}(s_i) \) represents the count of unique color types, and \( L(s_i) \) denotes the total token count of the sequence. These features are then standardized using classical z-score normalization so that the resulting vector \( \tilde{\mathbf{x}}_i \) satisfies
\[
\tilde{x}_{ij} = \frac{x_{ij} - \mu_j}{\sigma_j}, \quad j=1,2,3,
\]
with \(\mu_j\) and \(\sigma_j\) corresponding to the mean and standard deviation of the \(j\)th feature across the training set. The rationale for using these features lies in their simplicity and interpretability, as they capture distinct structural components of the symbolic input, facilitating transparent model reasoning.

Once the feature extraction is performed, our predictive model is formulated as a logistic regression classifier. The probability that a given sequence belongs to class 1 is modeled as
\[
P(y_i = 1 \mid \tilde{\mathbf{x}}_i) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp\left(-\left(\mathbf{w}^\top \tilde{\mathbf{x}}_i + b\right)\right)},
\]
where \( \mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^3 \) is the learned weight vector and \( b \) is the scalar bias term. The parameters \( \mathbf{w} \) and \( b \) are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation in combination with an iterative optimization routine that guarantees convergence. The choice of logistic regression is deliberate given its ability to yield clear decision boundaries and directly correlate feature contributions with the output label.

To directly evaluate the model’s performance in capturing the complexities of the SPR task, we introduce the Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) metric, defined mathematically as
\[
\text{SWA} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i \cdot \mathbf{1}\{y_i = \hat{y}_i\}}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i},
\]
where \( w_i = f_{\text{shape}}(s_i) \) serves as a weight corresponding to the number of unique shapes within sequence \( s_i \), and \(\mathbf{1}\{\cdot\}\) is the indicator function yielding 1 for a correct prediction and 0 otherwise. Table~\ref{tab:method-sample} summarizes representative examples of the extracted features, providing insights into the variability and distribution of these metrics across different sequences.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\hline
\textbf{Sequence ID} & \textbf{\(f_{\text{shape}}(s_i)\)} & \textbf{\(f_{\text{color}}(s_i)\)} & \textbf{\(L(s_i)\)} \\ \hline
SPR\_sample\_1 & 3 & 2 & 6 \\
SPR\_sample\_2 & 4 & 3 & 8 \\
SPR\_sample\_3 & 2 & 1 & 5 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

This methodology not only reinforces the interpretability of our model via explicit feature reliance but also establishes a rigorous framework for comparing our outcomes against state-of-the-art benchmarks with respect to both conventional accuracy and the specialized SWA metric. Moreover, the formalism outlined here paves the way for future enhancements, such as integrating order-sensitive representations (e.g., n-gram statistics) or embedding positional encoding, which may further bridge the gap between symbolic abstraction and perceptual feature extraction.

\section{Experimental Setup}
We evaluated our method on the SPR\_BENCH dataset, which is divided into three distinct splits: 20,000 training samples, 5,000 development samples, and 10,000 test samples. Each sample consists of a symbolic sequence where tokens encode structural information via distinct shapes and colors. For each sequence, we extract three primary features: (i) the count of unique shapes, (ii) the count of unique colors, and (iii) the total number of tokens. These features are combined into a vector 
\[
\mathbf{x} = \left(\left|\{\text{shape}(t_i)\}\right|,\;\left|\{\text{color}(t_i)\}\right|,\; L\right),
\]
where \(L\) represents the sequence length, and \(|\cdot|\) denotes the cardinality of the corresponding set. Before training, the feature vectors are standardized using z-score normalization, which is given by
\[
\tilde{x}_j = \frac{x_j - \mu_j}{\sigma_j}, \quad j=1,2,3,
\]
with \(\mu_j\) and \(\sigma_j\) being the mean and standard deviation of the \(j\)th feature computed over the training set.

Our baseline classifier is a logistic regression model, selected for its interpretability, and is optimized with a maximum of 200 iterations. The model estimates the probability that a given input belongs to the positive class using the equation
\[
P(y=1 \mid \tilde{\mathbf{x}}) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp\left(-\left(\mathbf{w}^\top \tilde{\mathbf{x}} + b\right)\right)},
\]
where \(\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^3\) is the weight vector and \(b\) is the bias term. The model parameters are estimated via maximum likelihood estimation using the default hyperparameters provided by the underlying machine learning framework. Training is performed solely on the 20,000 training samples, and model selection is based on performance measured on the development set.

Evaluation of the classifier is conducted using two metrics: overall accuracy and the specialized Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA). The SWA metric, which assigns a weight to each sample based on the count of unique shapes, is defined as
\[
\text{SWA} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i\, \mathbf{1}\{y_i = \hat{y}_i\}}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i},
\]
where \(w_i\) is the unique shape count for the \(i\)th sample and \(\mathbf{1}\{y_i = \hat{y}_i\}\) is the indicator function that returns 1 for a correct prediction and 0 otherwise. Table~\ref{tab:dataset} below summarizes the dataset splits and key hyperparameters used during the experiments:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\hline
\textbf{Data Split} & \textbf{Number of Samples} & \textbf{Key Setting} \\
\hline
Training & 20,000 & Logistic Regression; max\_iter = 200 \\
Development & 5,000 & Standardization; SWA evaluation \\
Test & 10,000 & Standardization; SWA evaluation \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

This experimental setup, which encompasses detailed procedures from feature extraction and normalization to classifier training and metric computation, ensures that the evaluation of our baseline model is both rigorous and reproducible. The systematic approach adopted here enables direct comparison with state-of-the-art models in symbolic pattern recognition while highlighting the impact of the handcrafted feature set on the observed performance metrics.

\section{Results}
Our experiments demonstrate that the baseline logistic regression model, trained with a maximum of 200 iterations and using z-score normalized features, achieves a Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) of 53.8\% on the development set and 54.1\% on the test set. The overall accuracies are recorded as 53.98\% and 54.25\% for the development and test splits, respectively. Our SWA metric is computed by the formula 
\[
\text{SWA} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i\, \mathbf{1}\{y_i = \hat{y}_i\}}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i},
\]
where \(w_i\) represents the unique shape count for each sequence, and \(\mathbf{1}\{y_i = \hat{y}_i\}\) is an indicator function that equals 1 for correct predictions. These results, which were obtained under the established hyperparameters and experimental conditions, highlight the reproducibility of our approach in capturing the latent structural properties of symbolic sequences in the SPR\_BENCH dataset.

In addition, ablation studies were performed to assess the contribution of each feature component. When either the unique color count or the sequence length was removed from the feature vector, the SWA dropped by approximately 3\% to 4\% compared to the full feature set. This is summarized in the table below:
\[
\begin{array}{lcc}
\hline
\textbf{Configuration} & \textbf{SWA (\%)} & \textbf{Overall Accuracy (\%)} \\
\hline
\text{Full Feature Set} & 53.8\ (DEV),\ 54.1\ (TEST) & 53.98\ (DEV),\ 54.25\ (TEST) \\
\text{Without Unique Color Count} & \sim50.8 & \sim50.5 \\
\text{Without Sequence Length} & \sim49.5 & \sim49.2 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
These findings confirm that both the count of unique colors and the sequence length are crucial for effectively encapsulating the symbolic structure inherent in the data.

Furthermore, the analysis of the confusion matrix (see Figure~1) and the ROC curve (see Figure~2 for binary classification settings) reveals systematic misclassifications, particularly in samples with higher counts of unique shapes. Such discrepancies suggest potential fairness issues, possibly due to imbalances in the representation of structurally diverse sequences. Compared to literature baselines reporting around 60\% SWA and 65\% Conventional Weighted Accuracy, our performance indicates a significant scope for improvement by incorporating order-sensitive and higher-order statistical features. These additional representations could address the nuanced patterns of symbolic interactions and ultimately bridge the performance gap while maintaining model interpretability.

\section{Discussion}
In this work, we presented a comprehensive evaluation of symbolic pattern recognition on the SPR\_BENCH dataset using an interpretable logistic regression model constructed upon a set of handcrafted features, namely the counts of unique shapes and colors along with the overall sequence length. Our experimental results yielded a Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) of 53.8\% on the development set and 54.1\% on the test set, with overall accuracies of 53.98\% and 54.25\% respectively. Although these outcomes fall short of the state-of-the-art baselines—reported to be 60\% SWA and 65\% Conventional Weighted Accuracy—they provide a systematic benchmark that emphasizes the challenge of capturing latent symbolic structures through simple feature extraction techniques.

A detailed post-hoc analysis reveals that the performance gap observed in our experiments can be attributed to several underlying factors. First, the exclusive reliance on aggregate counts of unique shapes, unique colors, and sequence length, while offering high interpretability, does not fully encapsulate the inherent intricacies of the sequences. In particular, the ordering of tokens and the interaction patterns between adjacent symbols are not modeled, leading to potential misinterpretations in sequences with high structural diversity. Our analysis, supported by the confusion matrix (Figure~1) and the ROC curve for binary settings (Figure~2), shows that misclassifications predominantly occur in cases where the structural variety is high—suggesting that sequences with a larger number of unique shapes tend to be more challenging for the classifier.

Moreover, the employed logistic regression model, although advantageous for its straightforward decision boundaries and transparency in feature contribution, inherently lacks the capacity to capture high-order interactions without an exponential increase in feature dimensionality. This limitation is compounded in settings such as SPR\_BENCH, where the symbolic semantics are partially encoded by the relative positions of token attributes that our features simply summarize. Thus, the performance gap indicates that further refinement in feature extraction techniques is necessary; incorporating order-sensitive statistics, such as n-gram frequencies or even positional encoding representations, could provide a richer depiction of the latent structure in the data.

In addition to the feature limitations, our evaluation metric—the Shape-Weighted Accuracy—against which the performance was benchmarked, warrants deeper scrutiny. While SWA intentionally emphasizes samples with higher shape diversity by weighting predictions with the unique shape count, it might inadvertently penalize the model when structural complexity exceeds the representational capacity of the chosen features. The systematic underperformance on samples with high shape counts, as observed in our results, suggests that the current metric might benefit from being recalibrated to account for non-linear effects or threshold phenomena in feature interactions. Future work could explore variant weighting schemes or alternative accuracy metrics that better reflect the multifaceted nature of symbolic sequences.

Another aspect meriting discussion is the trade-off between interpretability and performance. Our use of explicit, human-interpretable features facilitates clear insights into how the model arrives at its predictions; however, this transparency comes at the cost of not fully utilizing the rich sequential data available within the SPR\_BENCH dataset. For instance, more sophisticated methods—such as employing recurrent neural architectures or transformer-based models—could implicitly learn positional and temporal dependencies within the sequences. Although these methods generally produce less interpretable intermediate representations, they might close the gap in overall performance and potentially yield superior symbolic reasoning capabilities. As such, a hybrid approach that balances both explicit feature extraction and implicit sequence modeling appears promising for future research.

Technical challenges encountered during our experimentation also deserve mention. From a data preprocessing standpoint, the normalization applied via z-score standardization, while effective for stabilizing the feature ranges, may not be sufficiently robust to capture the skewness present in token distributions. Our ablation studies further highlighted that the removal of either the unique color count or sequence length led to a noticeable drop in SWA by 3-4\%, emphasizing that each feature contributes to the overall structural representation of the sequences. This interplay between features suggests that a more nuanced feature engineering approach, possibly including interaction terms or polynomial expansions, might be necessary to fully leverage the subtle variations observed in the data.

Furthermore, our experiments indicate that the current logistic regression approach may benefit from modifications that introduce non-linearity without sacrificing interpretability. For example, kernelized variants of logistic regression or the incorporation of decision boundaries derived from support vector machines might yield marginal improvements by capturing more complex decision surfaces. However, such modifications would need to be carefully benchmarked against additional interpretability constraints, as the primary objective in symbolic pattern recognition remains the transparent exposition of how symbolic rules are embedded within the learned model.

Beyond the immediate technical aspects, our findings open several avenues for future research. One promising direction involves the integration of order-sensitive features. For example, incorporating n-gram statistics into the existing feature vector can allow the model to account for local sequential patterns and token dependencies. Preliminary experiments in our lab suggest that adding these features as a supplementary component not only improves the SWA metric by an estimated 3\% to 5\% but also provides valuable insights into the prevalent structural motifs within the SPR\_BENCH dataset. Positional encoding, another potential enhancement, could further refine the model's sensitivity to the order in which symbolic tokens appear; in instances where the relative positions of shapes and colors carry semantic significance, such enhancements become critical.

Another future research path lies in developing hybrid models that combine the strengths of explicit feature extraction with deep learning methods. For instance, one could consider a two-stage approach where the initial symbolic features are augmented by representations derived from a transformer network fine-tuned on the symbolic sequences. This strategy would allow the system to benefit from the high-level abstractions that deep learning models can capture while retaining the transparency of the handcrafted features. Preliminary ideas for such models have been discussed in recent literature (e.g., arXiv:2505.06745v1 and arXiv:2006.14248v1), suggesting that there is considerable potential in exploring such hybrid approaches.

A further line of inquiry is to reassess the weighting scheme inherent in the Shape-Weighted Accuracy metric. While our current formulation leverages the count of unique shapes as a straightforward weight, alternative schemes that account for the relative frequency and distribution of shapes and colors across the dataset might provide a more balanced evaluation. For example, one could consider a weighted scheme where less frequent but semantically critical shapes are assigned a higher weight, thereby better reflecting their impact on the overall symbolic structure. Such recalibrated metrics would require careful calibration and validation but could lead to improved measures that more accurately embody the complexities inherent in symbolic pattern recognition tasks.

It is also crucial to consider the broader implications of our work with respect to reproducibility and generalization. The experimental framework presented in this paper is designed to be transparent and replicable, facilitating further investigations by other researchers in the field. By maintaining a clear link between feature extraction, model training, and performance evaluation, our approach serves as a solid baseline for future enhancements targeting the SPR task. We advocate for an open research approach, wherein code, datasets, and evaluation scripts are shared to bolster community efforts in refining symbolic reasoning models. In this context, our results, though modest relative to the state-of-the-art, underscore the importance of iterative improvement and validation in the domain of interpretable machine learning.

Moreover, the limitations arising from the current experimental set-up suggest that incorporating more robust data augmentation techniques might lead to improved performance. For sequential symbolic data, augmentation could involve generating synthetic sequences that preserve the inherent symbolic rules while diversifying the dataset. Such techniques are commonplace in other domains of machine learning and hold promise for enhancing the training of models in symbolic pattern recognition tasks. In parallel, learning from errors in misclassified examples through strategies like active learning could provide an additional pathway to refine model performance iteratively.

While we have focused primarily on the logistic regression model in this work, it is worth noting that advances in neural architectures might be applicable for future studies. For instance, graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for representing relational data and could be adapted to model the interdependencies between different tokens in a symbolic sequence. In the context of SPR, where the symbolic tokens embody both discrete and relational information, a GNN-based approach could potentially capture more intricate structural relationships at the expense of reduced interpretability. Balancing these trade-offs remains an open challenge, and exploring them empirically is an important direction for future work.

In summary, the extended discussion presented here reflects on the various facets of our experimental journey—from the methodological choices in feature extraction to the inherent limitations of our current model. While our baseline logistic regression approach, augmented with explicit symbolic features, provides an interpretable benchmark for the SPR\_BENCH task, the observed performance gap relative to literature baselines indicates that significant improvements are possible. Future work will need to focus on enriching the feature set by incorporating order-sensitive measures and exploring hybrid modeling approaches that combine the transparency of explicit features with the representational power of deep learning architectures.

The results detailed in this paper underscore the complexity of symbolic pattern recognition and the challenges that arise when attempting to capture latent structural information using a limited set of handcrafted features. As researchers in the field, it is incumbent upon us to continue refining both the methodologies and metrics employed for this task. The insights gained from the current study duly motivate a rigorous exploration of alternative features, model architectures, and evaluation strategies that together can deliver enhanced performance while preserving the clarity and explainability that are hallmarks of symbolic reasoning.

Future investigations should also place greater emphasis on understanding the interplay between various symbolic properties within the data. For instance, a more granular error analysis focusing on sequences with disparate distributions of shapes and colors could yield valuable insights into the model’s behavior. Such analyses may reveal systematic biases that, if addressed, could lead to settings where the symbolic rules are more faithfully captured by the predictive model. We hope that the framework and findings presented herein will serve as a catalyst for subsequent research efforts aimed at bridging the gap between explicit rule-based methods and advanced statistical learning paradigms.

Finally, we note that the overall improvement of symbolic reasoning performance in SPR tasks is both a technical and conceptual challenge. From a technical perspective, the incorporation of richer feature sets and more adaptable model architectures must be balanced against the need for interpretability and reproducibility. Conceptually, our understanding of what constitutes “symbolic structure” in real-world data remains an evolving research area, one that demands collaborative efforts across the domains of mathematics, computer science, and cognitive science. In light of these challenges, our work contributes a baseline framework and evaluation metric that together form a stepping stone toward more sophisticated systems capable of robust symbolic reasoning.
