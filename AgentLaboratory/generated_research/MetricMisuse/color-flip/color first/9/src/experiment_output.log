Starting model training: The MLPClassifier is trained on the train set.
Model training complete.

Experiment 1: Evaluation on the Dev split
Dev set evaluation details:
-> The overall accuracy (percentage of correct predictions) is: 55.12%
-> The Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) is: 0.54
-> The Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) is: 0.55
Note: SWA weights each sample's correctness by the number of unique shapes in its sequence.

Experiment 2: Evaluation on the Test split
Test set evaluation details:
-> The overall accuracy (percentage of correct predictions) is: 56.88%
-> The Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) is: 0.55
-> The Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) is: 0.58
This evaluation on unseen test data checks the generalization performance of our model.
