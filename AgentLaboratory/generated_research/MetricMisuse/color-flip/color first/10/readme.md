# Neuro-Symbolic RL Program Induction for SPR

This repository contains the code, experiments, and documentation for the Neuro-Symbolic Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for Program Induction in Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR) tasks. Our work integrates a lightweight transformer encoder with an RL-driven candidate rule synthesizer to produce explicit, interpretable symbolic program sketches while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy on synthetic SPR benchmarks.

## Overview

This repository implements the research described in our report:

- **Title:** Research Report: Neuro-Symbolic RL Program Induction for SPR  
- **Authors:** Agent Laboratory  
- **Abstract:**  
  We propose a novel neuro‐symbolic RL framework that fuses a transformer encoder producing global latent representations with an RL-based program synthesis branch that generates soft program sketches. The final prediction is a weighted combination of both direct classification and rule-based outputs governed by a learned gating function. This dual-headed approach facilitates enhanced interpretability in SPR tasks while balancing holistic feature extraction with explicit symbolic reasoning.

---

## Key Features

- **Transformer Encoder:** Extracts global latent representations from tokenized input sequences.
- **RL-based Program Synthesis:** Uses a one-step LSTM decoder to generate soft symbolic rule sketches.
- **Gating Mechanism:** Dynamically fuses the outputs of the direct classifier and the RL branch via a gating function \( g(x)=\sigma(Vx) \).
- **Dual Loss Objective:** Combines a primary cross-entropy loss for classification with an auxiliary RL reward loss and \( L_2 \) regularization to promote sparsity in the rule representation.
- **Interpretability:** Provides explicit candidate rule programs to enhance transparency and facilitate model debugging.
- **Experimental Evaluation:** Includes experiments on the synthetic SPR_BENCH dataset, with evaluation metrics like Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch (>=1.7)
- NumPy
- Other packages specified in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data

For this project, the SPR_BENCH synthetic dataset is included in the `experiments/spr_bench_data/` folder. The dataset consists of tokenized sequences representing (shape, color) pairs along with oracle rule annotations and shape complexity labels.

---

## Running the Code

### Training

To train the neuro-symbolic RL model, run:

```bash
python code/train.py --epochs 5 --batch_size 64 --lr 1e-3
```

This script:
- Loads the SPR_BENCH dataset.
- Constructs the transformer encoder and RL-based program synthesis branch.
- Trains the model with the combined loss:
  \[
  \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{CE} + \lambda\, \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{RL} + \beta\,\|\theta_{\mathrm{RL}}\|_2^2
  \]
  where \(\lambda = 0.5\) and \(\beta = 1 \times 10^{-4}\).

### Evaluation

After training, evaluate the model on the test set by running:

```bash
python code/eval.py --model_path path/to/saved_model.pth
```

The evaluation script computes:
- Standard classification accuracy.
- Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA):
  \[
  \text{SWA} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i\, \mathbb{1}\{y_i = \hat{y}_i\}}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i}
  \]
- Analysis of the gating network, including summary statistics of the gating weights.

## Experimental Results

Our experimental evaluation on SPR_BENCH yielded the following observations:

- The neuro-symbolic RL model achieved a test SWA of **57.58%**, while the baseline transformer+MLP model (without the RL branch) achieved **60.39%**.
- The gating mechanism \( g(x)=\sigma(Vx) \) balances the contribution of:
  - \( f_{\mathrm{direct}}(x)=\mathrm{softmax}(W_1x+b_1) \)
  - \( f_{\mathrm{RL}}(x)=\mathrm{softmax}(W_2x+b_2) \)
- Detailed analysis shows a mean gating weight of approximately \( \mu_g \approx 0.55 \) with notable variance, implying dynamic adaptation to input complexity.
- Ablation studies reveal that although the baseline has slightly higher accuracy, the RL branch’s explicit rule induction greatly enhances model transparency and interpretability.

Please refer to the `experiments/results/` folder for figures and detailed logs of the gating distribution and performance metrics.

## Discussion

While the baseline transformer+MLP model delivers a marginally higher SWA, our neuro-symbolic RL framework significantly improves interpretability by generating candidate symbolic rule programs. The explicit rule synthesis enables:
- Enhanced debugability: Inspect and verify generated rule sketches against domain knowledge.
- Increased transparency: Facilitate external audits in sensitive application areas such as healthcare and legal reasoning.

Our work highlights the trade-off between peak predictive performance and interpretability. Future work will extend training durations, explore multi-step decoding for rule synthesis, and evaluate on real-world data to further advance transparent neuro-symbolic systems.
