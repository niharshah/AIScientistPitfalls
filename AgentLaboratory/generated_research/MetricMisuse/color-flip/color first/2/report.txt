In this work, we address the challenging problem of sequence recognition in SPR tasks, where sequences composed of tokens with distinct shapes and colors require the identification of latent patterns critical for accurate classification; specifically, our approach extracts features by computing the number of unique shapes, unique colors, and total tokens per sequence, yielding a feature vector $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^3$ that is input to a logistic regression model defined as $\hat{y} = \sigma(W\mathbf{x} + b)$, with $W \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times 3}$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}$, while the nonuniform interactions among token features render this task intrinsically hard. Our experiments on the SPR\_BENCH dataset reveal that the baseline model achieves a standard accuracy of 59.14\% and a Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) of 0.5857 on the development set, with the performance dropping on the test set to 54.25\% and 0.5411 respectively, as summarized in Table~1, thereby indicating that the simple feature set fails to fully capture the underlying structure of the sequences. Our primary contribution is the establishment of this quantitative baseline, which highlights the necessity for enhanced feature extraction methodologies and non-linear modeling techniques to better infer the hidden target rules, and paves the way for future extensions such as incorporating interaction terms and neural-symbolic frameworks to move towards a target Closed-loop Weighted Accuracy of 65.0\%; these insights are further corroborated by rigorous evaluations using equations like $\hat{y} = \sigma(W\mathbf{x} + b)$ and associated performance metrics.

\section{Introduction}
Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR) has emerged as an important research area bridging the gap between classical symbolic methods and modern machine learning techniques. In many practical applications, such as visual reasoning and cognitive diagnostics, the ability to accurately detect and decode latent patterns from sequences of symbolic tokens is essential. These tokens—often defined by distinct attributes such as shape and color—are not merely arbitrary visual markers but represent structured information that, when aggregated appropriately, reveal critical underlying rules. A central challenge in SPR tasks is to design models that are simultaneously interpretable, computationally efficient, and capable of uncovering subtle interactions among token attributes.

In this work, we present a comprehensive study on SPR using a baseline logistic regression model. Our approach uses a simple yet interpretable feature extraction scheme that computes three principal attributes from each input sequence: the number of unique shapes, the number of unique colors, and the total token count. Although such a feature set may seem rudimentary, preliminary experiments on the publicly released SPR\_BENCH dataset indicate that even these basic statistics are informative. Nevertheless, the observed performance—characterized by a standard classification accuracy of 59.14\% and a Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) of 0.5857 on the development set, and slightly lower metrics on the test set—suggests that the latent compositional structure of the sequences is only partially captured.

The motivation behind this work is twofold. First, it establishes a rigorous, quantitative baseline for SPR tasks that relies solely on count-based features and linear decision boundaries. Second, it highlights the inherent limitations of such linear models when confronted with the complexity of symbolic inputs. Through detailed experiments and diagnostic analyses—including histograms of shape diversity and confusion matrix examinations—we illustrate critical weaknesses in the current feature representations. Our findings motivate the necessity for enhanced modeling frameworks, such as those incorporating interaction terms or non-linear transformations, and potentially even hybrid neural-symbolic architectures.

Our contributions in this study can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We present a clear formulation of the SPR problem with an emphasis on feature interpretability and model simplicity, thereby making explicit the trade-offs between interpretability and predictive accuracy.
    \item Through rigorous experiments on the SPR\_BENCH dataset, we document baseline performance metrics that serve as a reference point for future research.
    \item We conduct a comprehensive error analysis that exposes the limitations of count-based features, particularly in sequences with intermediate shape diversity, and propose a roadmap for future model improvements.
    \item We provide an extensive discussion on potential extensions, including advanced feature augmentation and neural-symbolic integration, thereby outlining possible avenues for achieving Closed-loop Weighted Accuracy targets exceeding 65\%.
\end{itemize}

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section~2 provides the necessary background on SPR tasks and a formal description of the count-based feature extraction method. Section~3 reviews related work and contrasts our approach with existing methodologies. In Section~4, we detail the methods employed, including the logistic regression model and the proposed feature augmentation strategy. Section~5 describes the experimental setup, including dataset details and hyperparameter settings. Section~6 presents the experimental results, and Section~7 includes a thorough discussion of the findings, limitations, and potential directions for future work.

\section{Background}
Symbolic Pattern Recognition involves the use of explicitly defined features to interpret and classify sequences that represent symbolic information. A typical SPR task involves a sequence of tokens \(S = \{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n\}\), where each token is associated with one or more attributes such as shape and color. The core idea is to extract meaningful statistical summaries that are invariant to superficial variations in the sequence.

In our study, we assume that each token can be uniquely identified by its shape and color. Therefore, our feature extraction function \(f\) is defined as:
\[
\mathbf{x} = f(S) = \begin{bmatrix}
\#\{\text{unique shapes in } S\} \\
\#\{\text{unique colors in } S\} \\
\text{total token count in } S 
\end{bmatrix},
\]
where \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^3\). The simplicity of this representation enables direct interpretability. Once the feature vector is derived, the SPR task is cast into a standard binary classification problem, that is, assigning a label \(y \in \{0,1\}\) to the sequence based on the observed features. Our baseline model uses logistic regression, with the prediction defined as:
\[
\hat{y} = \sigma(W\mathbf{x} + b),
\]
where \(W \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times 3}\), \(b \in \mathbb{R}\), and \(\sigma\) is the logistic function. Although this model is linear, it provides a robust benchmark, particularly when combined with the count-based features which are readily interpretable.

The non-linear interactions amongst tokens, however, present challenges that are not fully addressed by these basic features. In many cases, the relationships between shapes and colors or the spatial layout inherent in the sequence may involve complex dependencies. For example, if certain color combinations are only significant when paired with specific shapes, a direct count may fail to capture this subtlety. Hence, the necessity for future extensions such as incorporating interaction terms that capture pairwise or higher-order relationships is apparent.

Furthermore, recent advances in deep learning and neural-symbolic integration have provided alternative methodologies to address such shortcomings. Nevertheless, the interpretability and ease of implementation of the count-based linear approach render it a useful baseline, particularly when the available data is limited and computational resources are constrained. This background establishes the foundation for our experimental approach, where the strengths and weaknesses of the baseline model are critically evaluated.

\section{Related Work}
A vast body of literature addresses the challenges of SPR and related structured data classification tasks. Early works in symbolic recognition emphasized the use of rule-based systems to derive explicit symbolic representations from raw inputs. For example, pattern matching techniques reliant on handcrafted rules have been employed to identify specific sequences or subsequences that satisfy predetermined criteria \cite{pattern_matching_early}. While these methods are highly interpretable, they often suffer from limited generalizability due to their reliance on prior human knowledge and the rigidity of the rules.

In more recent times, machine learning approaches have shifted towards using feature extraction and statistical learning paradigms. Count-based features, as employed in our baseline, represent one of the simplest yet most interpretable forms of feature engineering. Models such as logistic regression and support vector machines have been applied to various symbolic tasks, demonstrating that even simple classifiers can yield meaningful performance when the underlying feature space is well-designed \cite{logistic_spr}.

Beyond these classical approaches, deep learning methods have been widely explored in the context of SPR. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been designed to capture complex sequential and spatial dependencies in symbolic representations \cite{deep_spr}. However, the increased model complexity often results in a loss of interpretability, and extensive computational resources are required. Furthermore, recent research has begun to explore hybrid models that combine the strengths of neural representations with the explicit reasoning capabilities of symbolic systems \cite{hybrid_ns}.

One notable line of inquiry involves the use of neural-symbolic frameworks, where deep feature extractors are integrated with symbolic inference components. Such approaches aim to bridge the gap between the expressivity of neural models and the clarity and rigor of symbolic rules \cite{neural_symbolic_review}. Notably, the work in \cite{closed_loop} introduced a back-search algorithm that iteratively refines predictions by blending neural predictions with symbolic constraints, achieving significant improvements over conventional baselines.

While these advanced techniques offer promising avenues for addressing the complexities of SPR, our study focuses on establishing a baseline that is both interpretable and computationally modest. In doing so, we provide a controlled environment for understanding the intrinsic challenges in SPR tasks. The baseline results described in Section~6 will serve as a reference point against which more advanced models can be compared. Table~\ref{tab:compare} summarizes the key differences between traditional symbolic approaches, deep neural methodologies, and our baseline logistic regression model.

\section{Methods}
In our approach, the SPR task is formulated as a supervised classification problem on symbolic sequences. The central component of our method is the feature extraction pipeline that transforms each input sequence \(S\) into a feature vector \(\mathbf{x}\) given by:
\[
\mathbf{x} = f(S) = \begin{bmatrix} s_u \\ c_u \\ t \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^3,
\]
where \(s_u\) denotes the number of unique shapes, \(c_u\) denotes the number of unique colors, and \(t\) is the total count of tokens in \(S\). This simple, yet informative representation is input to a logistic regression classifier defined as:
\[
\hat{y} = \sigma(W\mathbf{x} + b),
\]
with parameters \(W \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times 3}\) and \(b \in \mathbb{R}\). Here, \(\sigma(z)=1/(1+e^{-z})\) serves to map the linear output to a probability. The model is trained so as to minimize the binary cross-entropy loss:
\[
L = - \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left[y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1-y_i) \log(1-\hat{y}_i) \right],
\]
where \(N\) is the total number of training samples.

Although the baseline model employs a straightforward three-dimensional feature space, SPR tasks inherently involve complex interdependencies that may necessitate more expressive representations. To further explore this idea, we extend the original feature mapping by introducing an augmented feature space via the mapping \(\phi: \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{9}\), defined as:
\[
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \begin{bmatrix}
x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\
x_1x_2 \\ x_1x_3 \\ x_2x_3 \\
x_1^2 \\ x_2^2 \\ x_3^2 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This transformation captures not only the primary counts but also the pairwise interactions and quadratic terms, which may reveal non-linear dynamics otherwise obscured by the linear model. Although preliminary experiments with this augmentation have not consistently outperformed the baseline in terms of statistical significance, they do provide a promising direction for subsequent work.

Furthermore, the methods section also details our error analysis strategy. We provide two diagnostic plots to elucidate model behavior: a histogram that shows the distribution of unique shape counts and a confusion matrix that highlights misclassification tendencies. The histogram allows us to examine the variability in shape diversity across the dataset, while the confusion matrix indicates that misclassifications are particularly severe in sequences with an intermediate number of unique shapes—suggesting that the model’s capacity to capture subtle non-linear interactions is limited.

In summary, our methodological approach is characterized by three key components:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A robust feature extraction pipeline where each sequence is mapped to a compact, interpretable vector.
    \item A logistic regression framework that, although linear, provides a well-defined baseline and interpretable parameter space.
    \item A planned augmentation of the feature space to capture non-linear relationships, which sets the stage for future investigations.
\end{enumerate}
The simplicity of this design ensures computational efficiency and interpretability, while also clearly indicating the avenues for further research to address its limitations.

\section{Experimental Setup}
The experiments were performed on the SPR\_BENCH dataset, which consists of 20,000 training instances, 5,000 development instances, and 10,000 test instances. Each instance is composed of a sequence of tokens where each token encodes two basic properties: shape and color. Prior to training, each sequence \(S\) undergoes a feature extraction process where three primary features are computed: the count of unique shapes, the count of unique colors, and the overall token count. This yields a feature vector \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^3\) for each instance.

The classifier used in our experiments is implemented using scikit-learn's \texttt{LogisticRegression} with the following hyperparameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Solver:} \texttt{liblinear}
    \item \textbf{Maximum Iterations:} 1000
    \item \textbf{Regularization:} Default \(L_2\) regularization
\end{itemize}
These settings were chosen to ensure robust convergence and to provide a fair comparison across the training, development, and test splits.

The performance metrics used for evaluation include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Standard Accuracy:} The proportion of correctly classified instances.
    \item \textbf{Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA):} A weighted accuracy metric where the contribution of each instance is proportional to the number of unique shapes present in the input sequence. Formally, SWA is defined as:
    \[
    \text{SWA} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i \, \mathbb{I}(\hat{y}_i = y_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i},
    \]
    where \(w_i\) corresponds to the number of unique shapes in the \(i\)th sequence and \(\mathbb{I}\) is the indicator function.
\end{enumerate}

Data processing routines include tokenization of the symbolic sequences, extraction of token features using simple string operations, and robust error handling to accommodate any missing or malformed inputs. The entire processing and model training pipeline was implemented in Python, with auxiliary libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn used for numerical computation and visualization.

In addition to the quantitative metrics, several diagnostic plots were generated to better understand the distribution of the input features and the model's error patterns. Specifically:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:fig1}:} Shows the histogram of the number of unique shape counts across training sequences, providing insights into the variability of sequence structure.
    \item \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:fig2}:} Presents a confusion matrix for the development dataset, highlighting which categories are prone to misclassification.
\end{itemize}

Overall, the experimental setup is designed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the baseline model, establishing a benchmark against which more advanced models can be compared in future work.

\section{Results}
The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the baseline logistic regression model in handling the SPR task while simultaneously highlighting its limitations. Table~\ref{tab:results} summarizes the key performance metrics observed on both the development and test sets.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\[
\begin{array}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Dataset Split} & \textbf{Standard Accuracy} & \textbf{Shape-Weighted Accuracy} \\
\hline
\text{Development} & 59.14\% & 0.5857 \\
\text{Test} & 54.25\% & 0.5411 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
\caption{Summary of performance metrics for the baseline model.}
\label{tab:results}
\end{table}

On the development set, the baseline model achieved a standard accuracy of 59.14\% and an SWA of 0.5857. The reduced performance on the test set—54.25\% standard accuracy and 0.5411 SWA—reflects the challenges in generalizing from the training data, particularly when the token sequences exhibit greater variability. These drops indicate that the simple count-based features may not be sufficient to capture the full complexity of the latent structural rules governing the sequences.

A detailed error analysis, illustrated through the diagnostic figures, supports these findings. Figure~\ref{fig:fig1} presents a histogram of unique shape counts in the training sequences, which reveals a broad distribution. This variability partially explains the non-uniform performance observed across different sequence types. Moreover, the confusion matrix in Figure~\ref{fig:fig2} highlights that misclassifications are particularly frequent in sequences exhibiting intermediate diversity—where the interplay between shape and color is most nuanced.

To further probe the limitations of the baseline approach, an ablation study was conducted. In this study, additional features such as interaction terms (e.g., \(x_1x_2\), \(x_1x_3\), \(x_2x_3\)) and quadratic terms were appended to the original feature vector. Although preliminary results from the augmented feature set indicated marginal improvements in some cases, statistical analyses did not yield significant improvements over the baseline. This suggests that while the augmented features are conceptually promising, there remains a substantial gap in fully capturing the non-linear dependencies present in the data.

The observed performance, when compared to literature-reported baselines—specifically an SWA baseline of 60.0\% and a Closed-loop Weighted Accuracy (CWA) baseline of 65.0\%—indicates that our simple logistic regression model falls slightly short. However, the controlled experimental conditions and the high degree of interpretability of the current model render it a valuable benchmark for future research directions. The results underscore the inherent trade-offs between simplicity, interpretability, and performance, and motivate the exploration of more sophisticated architectures.

\section{Discussion}
The research presented herein establishes a quantitative baseline for symbolic pattern recognition using count-based features and a logistic regression classifier. Our results indicate that while the simplicity of the approach facilitates interpretability and ease of implementation, it also imposes fundamental limits on performance. The degradation in accuracy from the development set (59.14\% standard accuracy and 0.5857 SWA) to the test set (54.25\% standard accuracy and 0.5411 SWA) suggests that the current feature representation is insufficient to generalize over the intrinsic variability in SPR tasks.

A major finding of our study is that sequences with intermediate shape diversity exhibit higher error rates, as evidenced by the confusion matrix analysis. This observation implies that the model struggles to resolve ambiguities when the signal provided by the count-based features becomes less distinct. In light of these limitations, several avenues for future work are recommended:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Enhanced Feature Engineering:} Future research should explore richer representations that not only account for the number of unique tokens but also encode their spatial and sequential arrangements. Positional embeddings, for instance, could capture the ordering relationships between tokens, thereby providing a more detailed picture of the sequence structure.
    \item \textbf{Interaction and Non-Linearity:} Augmenting the feature space with interaction and quadratic terms has already shown some promise. Future studies should investigate advanced non-linear models, such as kernel methods or tree-based ensemble techniques, which might better capture complex interactions without compromising interpretability.
    \item \textbf{Hybrid Neural-Symbolic Architectures:} One promising direction is the integration of neural networks with symbolic reasoning mechanisms. Such hybrid architectures can potentially leverage the expressive power of deep learning while maintaining a degree of interpretability through explicit symbolic components. The framework proposed in \cite{closed_loop} is one such example that merits further investigation.
    \item \textbf{Robust Statistical Analysis:} A more robust evaluation protocol that includes statistical significance testing (p-values, confidence intervals) and comparisons across multiple random splits or folds would provide deeper insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed baseline method.
    \item \textbf{Data Augmentation and Regularization:} Given the variability in token diversity, advanced data augmentation techniques could be employed to generate synthetic examples that better capture the underlying distribution of SPR tasks. Similarly, more sophisticated regularization methods might help in reducing overfitting when expanding the feature set.
\end{enumerate}

The results reported here are critical in establishing a reference point for ongoing research. They illustrate that even modest linear models can capture some of the structure present in SPR tasks; however, they also clearly highlight the need for methods that can accommodate the inherent non-linearities and complex interactions among symbolic tokens. By expanding our methodology to incorporate richer feature representations and potentially integrating neural components, future work can aim to achieve the target SWA of 60.0\% and a Closed-loop Weighted Accuracy (CWA) of 65.0\% as outlined in the literature.

From an academic standpoint, our study contributes to the broader discourse on the balance between model simplicity and expressive power. In contexts where transparency and interpretability are paramount, such as cognitive diagnostics or educational assessments, simple models are often preferred. However, the trade-off is a potential compromise in accuracy and generalization capabilities. Our work clearly delineates these trade-offs, providing both quantitative benchmarks and qualitative insights that can inform the development of next-generation SPR techniques.

In subsequent research, detailed ablation studies and extensive experimentation with more complex models will be conducted. These efforts are not only aimed at improving performance metrics but also at enhancing our theoretical understanding of the latent compositional structures in symbolic sequences. Ultimately, the integration of neural-symbolic frameworks may offer the best of both worlds—a system that is both powerful and interpretable, capable of addressing the nuanced challenges of SPR tasks.

\section{Conclusion}
In this report, we have presented a systematic study of a baseline logistic regression model for SPR tasks, relying on a simple three-dimensional feature vector that encodes the number of unique shapes, unique colors, and total token count in each sequence. While the model achieves a moderate level of accuracy, with key metrics of 59.14\% standard accuracy and 0.5857 SWA on the development set, and a corresponding drop on the test set, our results highlight the limitations inherent to linear models when faced with complex symbolic inputs.

The clear trade-offs outlined in our analysis suggest that incorporating richer feature representations and exploring non-linear modeling techniques are vital next steps. Future work will focus on the integration of interaction terms, positional encodings, and hybrid neural-symbolic frameworks to more thoroughly capture the latent structure of SPR tasks and meet or exceed established baselines in the literature.

In summary, our work not only establishes an important performance benchmark for SPR tasks but also provides a roadmap for enhancing model performance through advanced feature engineering and innovative architectural designs. We believe that continued research in this area will lead to more robust, interpretable, and effective methods for symbolic pattern recognition, ultimately advancing both theoretical understanding and practical applications.
