Training logistic regression classifier on the training set...
Training completed.

Evaluation on the Development Set:
The results on the dev set are meant to show the classifier's performance on unseen data from the same distribution as training.
Standard Accuracy on Dev set: 59.14%
Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) on Dev set: 0.5857
Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) on Dev set: 0.5745

Evaluation on the Test Set:
The following results are the final performance metrics on the withheld test set to validate generalization.
Standard Accuracy on Test set: 54.25%
Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) on Test set: 0.5411
Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) on Test set: 0.5405
