Starting Training:
This experiment trains a dual-branch SPR model that integrates discrete token embedding,
a graph-based relational module, and a transformer branch.
The classification branch outputs binary predictions (accept/reject), and the rule extraction
branch simulates symbolic rule extraction. The training loss is a combination of BCE loss
for classification and a rule consistency loss (MSE) with weight lambda_rule = 0.1
---------------------------------------------------

Epoch 1/3 -- Avg Loss: 0.7556 | Dev Accuracy: 68.00%
Epoch 2/3 -- Avg Loss: 0.6276 | Dev Accuracy: 62.00%
Epoch 3/3 -- Avg Loss: 0.5380 | Dev Accuracy: 72.00%

Running evaluation on the Test set.
This experiment evaluates the model's overall classification accuracy, as well as
Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) and Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), which assess the
model's performance on sequences with varying color and shape complexities.

Test Set Evaluation Metrics:
Overall Test Accuracy: 52.00%
Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA): 52.73%
Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA): 49.72%
Test accuracy is non-zero. The model appears to be learning.
