## Overview

In many neuro-symbolic tasks, it is essential to capture both localized token-level details and global semantic structures. Our dual-branch framework addresses these challenges by:

- **Discrete Token Embedding:** Employing a Gumbel Softmax-based differentiable quantization (inspired by Discrete JEPA) to encode tokens into near one-hot representations that capture high-level semantics.
- **Graph-Based Relational Modeling:** Utilizing self-attention mechanisms to simulate graph neural network message-passing and effectively model inter-token dependencies.
- **Dual-Loss Optimization:** Simultaneously optimizing a classification loss (binary cross-entropy) for SPR and a rule extraction loss (mean squared error) to ensure consistency between the extracted symbolic rule and the ground truth.

The proposed approach shows promising results on synthetic SPR benchmarks and lays down a robust foundation for future research in neuro-symbolic reasoning and interpretability.

## Key Features

- **Integrated Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning:** Captures both discrete symbolic representations and continuous, detailed token embeddings.
- **Graph-Enhanced Modeling:** Leverages self-attention for relational reasoning to extract rules and capture token dependencies.
- **Dual-Loss Framework:** Balances binary classification (SPR decision) with interpretable symbolic rule extraction.
- **Reproducible Experiments:** Implementation details, including hyperparameters and training procedures, are provided for consistent replication.

## Architecture

The method follows a dual-branch design:

1. **Discrete Embedding Branch:**
   - Maps input token sequence S = {x₁, x₂, ..., xₗ} to continuous embeddings.
   - Uses a learned projection followed by a Gumbel Softmax operation to generate discrete representations (z₍disc₎).

2. **Graph-Based Relational Module:**
   - Constructs a token similarity graph using self-attention.
   - Computes attention weights with a scaled dot-product attention formulation to capture inter-token relationships.
   - Aggregates refined token features via average pooling.

3. **Fusion and Decision Head:**
   - Concatenates features from both branches.
   - Feeds the fused representation into a fully connected layer for binary classification.
   - Simultaneously employs a rule extraction branch minimizing the MSE between predicted and ground truth symbolic rules.

The overall loss is defined as:
  L₍total₎ = L₍cls₎ + λ L₍rule₎  
where λ = 0.1.

## Experimental Setup

- **Dataset:** A synthetically generated SPR dataset where each token has a shape (e.g., △, □, ●, ◊) and a color (r, g, b, y). Sequences are labeled as accepted or rejected based on a hidden poly‑factor rule.
- **Metrics:** 
  - Overall Accuracy
  - Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA)
  - Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA)

- **Hyperparameters:** (see `experiments/hyperparams.yaml`)
  - Embedding Dimension: 64
  - Codebook Size: 16
  - Transformer Layers: 1 with 4 attention heads
  - λ (Rule Extraction Weight): 0.1
  - Optimizer: Adam with 1e-3 learning rate
  - Batch Size: 16
  - Epochs: 3

## Results

The experiments demonstrated the following:

- **Training Loss Convergence:** Decreased from 0.7556 (Epoch 1) to 0.5380 (Epoch 3).
- **Test Set Performance:**
  - Overall Accuracy: 52.00%
  - Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA): 52.73%
  - Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA): 49.72%

While these metrics are below state-of-the-art baselines (Accuracy ~65%, SWA ~70%), the results validate the design choices and the potential of a dual-branch approach to capture both symbolic semantics and token-level details.

## Discussion & Future Work

### Key Observations

- **Interpretability:** The discrete token embedding via Gumbel Softmax supports the extraction of interpretable symbolic rules.
- **Graph Reasoning:** The self-attention based relational module effectively models inter-token dependencies.
- **Performance Gap:** Although promising, current performance lags behind state-of-the-art systems, suggesting the need for further enhancements.

### Future Directions

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Explore adaptive weighting for balancing classification and rule extraction losses.
- **Advanced Graph Modules:** Investigate explicit message-passing networks and graph convolutional layers.
- **Enhanced Rule Extraction:** Implement more sophisticated symbolic rule extraction methods (e.g., tree-based models) for improved interpretability.
- **Real-World Applications:** Extend experiments to more complex and noisy datasets to evaluate generalization.
