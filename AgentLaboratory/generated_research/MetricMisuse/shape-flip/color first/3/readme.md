# Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic Transformer for SPR Task

Welcome to the Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic Transformer repository. This project presents a novel end-to-end trainable model that integrates a lightweight transformer encoder with a differentiable symbolic module to solve the Surgical Phase Recognition (SPR) task. The design simultaneously addresses high predictive performance and interpretability by extracting atomic predicate-level insights (e.g., shape-count, color-position, parity, and order) that guide the final decision-making process.

## Overview

This repository implements a hybrid neuro-symbolic transformer model for binary classification on synthetic SPR datasets. Each input sequence consists of tokens where each token is a shape–color pair. The model must determine if a sequence adheres to an underlying, latent poly-factor rule. By fusing deep contextual representations from a transformer with handcrafted symbolic features extracted via differentiable submodules, our approach alleviates the exponential complexity of traditional symbolic methods while maintaining transparency.

Key aspects include:
- **Dual Branch Architecture:** A transformer encoder for global feature extraction and a symbolic module with distinct branches for predicate-level operations.
- **Interpretability:** Features that capture shape-count, color-position, parity, and order are extracted and fused via a gating mechanism.
- **Robustness:** Experiments demonstrate high accuracy under controlled settings and resilience in noisy conditions.

## Features

- **End-to-End Trainable:** Integrates neural and symbolic components in a unified training pipeline.
- **Multi-Branch Symbolic Module:** Computes features using mean pooling, max pooling, tanh activations (for parity), and consecutive difference operations (for order).
- **Interpretability:** Provides insights into which atomic predicates are driving decisions.
- **Scalability:** Mitigates the exponential blowup (O(2^n)) commonly found in symbolic rule extraction systems.
- **Robust Performance:** Evaluated on synthetic SPR datasets with clean and noisy conditions.

## Architecture

The model's decision function is formalized as:
  
  ŷ = σ( W · concat( h_transformer, h_symbolic ) + b )

### Transformer Branch

- **Input Representation:** Each token is embedded as a combination of shape, color, and positional features:
  - eₜ = Embed_shape(sₜ) + Embed_color(cₜ) + Embed_pos(t)
- **Self-Attention:** Processes embeddings via multi-head self-attention layers.
- **Global Representation:** Obtained via mean pooling:
  - h_transformer = (1/L) Σ (zₜ)

### Symbolic Module

The symbolic branch captures four atomic predicates:
- **Shape-Count:** Mean pooling followed by a linear projection.
- **Color-Position:** Max pooling to emphasize dominant color cues.
- **Parity:** Summation of embeddings passed through tanh and a linear layer.
- **Order:** Consecutive token difference computations averaged and projected.
  
Features are fused using a softmax-based gating mechanism:
  
  h_symbolic = Σ αᵢ · hᵢ   (αᵢ = softmax(gᵢ))

The final decision is made by fusing both representations.

## Usage

### Training

To train the model on the synthetic SPR dataset:

```
python train.py --epochs 3 --batch_size 64 --learning_rate 1e-3
```

Hyperparameters (e.g., Embedding Dimension = 32, Transformer Layers = 2, Attention Heads = 4) are configured in the script or via command-line arguments.

### Evaluation

Evaluate the model on the development and test sets:

```
python evaluate.py --model_path <path_to_trained_model> --dataset <dev|test|noisy>
```

The evaluation script computes:
- Overall Accuracy (%)
- Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA)
- Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA)

Results are displayed on the console and optionally saved to disk.

### Observed Results

- **Development Set:**
  - Combined Model: Overall Accuracy: 89.38% | CWA: 89.58% | SWA: 89.55%
  - Transformer Only: ~78%
  - Symbolic Only: ~70%

- **Test Set (Clean):**
  - Combined Model: Overall Accuracy: 65.16% | CWA: 65.78% | SWA: 61.13%

- **Test Set (Noisy):**
  - Combined Model: Overall Accuracy: 65.00% | CWA: 65.37% | SWA: 62.02%

These experiments validate that the hybrid architecture effectively leverages both global contextual information and interpretable predicate-level features, resulting in enhanced performance and robustness.
