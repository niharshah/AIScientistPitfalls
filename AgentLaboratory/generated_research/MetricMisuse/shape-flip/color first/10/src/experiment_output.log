Loaded SPR_BENCH dataset splits: ['train', 'dev', 'test']

Example from train dataset:
{'id': 'SPR_train_0', 'sequence': '●y ●g ●r ■r ▲y ▲g', 'label': 0}
Converted dataset splits to pandas DataFrames.
Extracted features from train, dev, and test splits.

Experiment 1: Logistic Regression training performance
This experiment tests whether our simple linear model can correctly classify the training instances and generalize to development data based on the engineered features.
Training Accuracy: 77.82%
Development Accuracy: 77.88%

Experiment 2: Test performance on SPR_BENCH with custom metrics
This experiment evaluates the classifier on the test set using three metrics:
 - Label Accuracy: Overall percent of test instances correctly classified.
 - Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA): Giving higher weight to sequences with greater color diversity.
 - Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA): Giving higher weight to sequences with greater shape diversity.
Test Label Accuracy: 64.93%
Test Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA): 61.23%
Test Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA): 64.78%
