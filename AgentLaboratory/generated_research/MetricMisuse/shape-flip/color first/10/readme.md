# Symbolic Pattern Recognition via a Hybrid Approach

Welcome to the repository for our research on symbolic pattern recognition in SPR tasks. In this work, we investigate a hybrid methodology that merges classical feature engineering with modern deep representation learning to address the challenges inherent in symbolic sequence data. The repository contains our experimental code, dataset information, and detailed documentation related to the baseline logistic regression model and our proposed future directions.

## Overview

Symbolic pattern recognition (SPR) tasks require understanding complex interdependencies among symbol tokens that typically represent various attributes (e.g., colors and shapes). Our study proposes a novel hybrid approach that:

- **Establishes a baseline:** Uses engineered features (token count, color complexity, shape complexity, etc.) and a logistic regression model.
- **Evaluates performance:** Employs standard accuracy metrics along with custom metrics—Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) and Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA).
- **Highlights challenges:** Analyzes limitations of linear models in handling high-complexity symbolic sequences.
- **Motivates hybrid designs:** Lays the groundwork for future integration of deep learning components such as graph neural networks and feedforward networks with symbolic reasoning.

The detailed experimental study is described in our research report (provided as a LaTeX document in this repository).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spr-hybrid-approach.git
   cd spr-hybrid-approach
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the dataset:**

   Ensure that the SPR_BENCH dataset is placed in the `data/SPR_BENCH/` directory. Instructions for obtaining the dataset are provided in the dataset documentation.

## Usage

To run the experiments and reproduce the baseline results:

1. Navigate to the `experiments/` folder.
2. Execute the main experiment script:

   ```
   python run_experiment.py
   ```

This script performs:
- Feature extraction from the symbolic sequences.
- Training a logistic regression classifier using the engineered features.
- Evaluation using overall accuracy as well as custom metrics (CWA and SWA).
- Generation of diagnostic visualizations (confusion matrix and complexity distribution histograms).

Output results and figures will be saved in the appropriate results directory.

## Experimental Setup

The experimental setup is based on the following specifications:

- **Dataset:** SPR_BENCH, comprising symbolic sequences where each token has an associated color (r, g, b, y) and shape (△, □, ○, ◊).
- **Feature Vector Construction:**  
  For each sequence, we build an enriched feature vector:
  - Token count (nᵢ)
  - Unique color count (cᵢ)
  - Unique shape count (sᵢ)
  - Frequency counts of each specific color and shape.
- **Model:** Logistic regression with a sigmoid activation:
  
  p(yᵢ = 1 | xᵢ) = σ(wᵀxᵢ + b)
  
- **Optimization:** Utilizes the `liblinear` solver with a maximum of 1000 iterations and hyperparameters tuned on the development split.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - **Training Accuracy:** ~77.82%
  - **Test Accuracy:** ~64.93%
  - **Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA):** ~61.23%
  - **Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA):** ~64.78%

Detailed hyperparameters and dataset statistics are provided in the research report.

## Results

Our baseline logistic regression model achieves the following metrics:

| Metric                        | Value    |
| ----------------------------- | -------- |
| Training Accuracy             | 77.82%   |
| Test Accuracy                 | 64.93%   |
| Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) | 61.23%   |
| Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) | 64.78%   |

Diagnostic visualizations (found in the `figures/` folder) illustrate:
- A confusion matrix indicating higher misclassification rates for sequences with high symbolic diversity.
- Histograms showing the distribution of color and shape complexities within the test set.

## Discussion & Future Work

### Discussion

The baseline experiments reveal:
- A noticeable gap between training and test performance, especially on sequences with high color and shape complexity.
- Limitations of linear classifiers in capturing non-linear interdependencies inherent in symbolic sequences.
- The effectiveness of engineered features, though their fixed nature restricts the model’s adaptability to more complex scenarios.

### Future Work

Future directions aim to:
- **Integrate Deep Learning:** Combine graph neural networks and deep feedforward architectures with symbolic reasoning modules for non-linear representation.
- **Dynamic Feature Extraction:** Develop adaptive feature learning methods, potentially using self-supervised or reinforcement learning paradigms.
- **Custom Loss Functions:** Explore loss functions that penalize misclassifications in high-complexity conditions more rigorously.
- **Data Augmentation:** Enrich the training dataset with synthetically generated symbolic sequences to improve model generalization.

These advancements are expected to yield robust performance that rivals state-of-the-art methods while preserving interpretability.
