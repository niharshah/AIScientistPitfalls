Starting training: In this experiment, a hybrid neuro-symbolic model is trained. The transformer encoder extracts contextualized embeddings from the input sequences, and a differentiable symbolic verifier aggregates candidate rule scores for final binary classification. We expect training loss to decrease and development accuracy to improve over epochs, demonstrating that the model learns both sequential and symbolic patterns.
Epoch 1/2: Train Loss = 0.6931, Train Accuracy = 51.10%, Dev Accuracy = 55.10%
Epoch 2/2: Train Loss = 0.6620, Train Accuracy = 65.20%, Dev Accuracy = 77.80%

Evaluating final performance on the Test set: This evaluation reports the overall test accuracy along with two specialized symbolic metrics. The Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) emphasizes correct classifications on sequences with higher color diversity, while the Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) highlights performance on sequences with complex shape arrangements. High scores indicate robust symbolic pattern recognition.
Test Accuracy (overall): 61.00%
Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) on Test set: 61.59%
Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) on Test set: 57.95%

Final experiment results: Overall Test Accuracy: 61.00%, Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA): 61.59%, Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA): 57.95%
