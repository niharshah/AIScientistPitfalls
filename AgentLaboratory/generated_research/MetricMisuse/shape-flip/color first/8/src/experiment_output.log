Dataset splits: ['train', 'dev', 'test']

Example from train split:
{'id': 'SPR_train_0', 'sequence': '●y ●g ●r ■r ▲y ▲g', 'label': 0}
Preparing features for training data: extracting number of unique colors, shapes and total tokens per sequence.
Preparing features for development data: extracting number of unique colors, shapes and total tokens per sequence.
Preparing features for test data: extracting number of unique colors, shapes and total tokens per sequence.

Experiment 1: Training a baseline Logistic Regression classifier using simple features (unique color count, unique shape count, and sequence length).

Results of Logistic Regression Classifier:
Training Accuracy: 61.56%
Development Accuracy: 59.14%
Test Accuracy: 54.41%

Detailed Metric Evaluation on Test Data:
Standard Accuracy: 54.41%
Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA): 54.53%
Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA): 52.87%

Note: CWA emphasizes performance on instances with high color diversity, while SWA emphasizes instances with high shape diversity.

Experiment 2: Generating figures to showcase experimental results. Figure_1.png shows the comparison of standard accuracy, CWA, and SWA on test data. Figure_2.png displays the confusion matrix for test set predictions.

Experiments complete. Figures saved as 'Figure_1.png' and 'Figure_2.png'.
