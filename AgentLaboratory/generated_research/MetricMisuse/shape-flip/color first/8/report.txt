\begin{abstract}
This paper presents an in-depth investigation into the integration of enhanced neuro‐symbolic representations within machine learning frameworks aimed at visual symbolic reasoning tasks. Our approach addresses the limitations of conventional System-1 learning, which relies almost exclusively on statistical and deep learning methods, by incorporating explicit symbolic reasoning reflective of System-2 cognitive processes. We formalize a symbolic system in which each rule is expressed as a directed hyperedge of the form 
\[
r: m_1 \wedge m_2 \wedge \cdots \wedge m_n \models c,
\]
where the premises \(m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n\) are combined to infer a conclusion \(c\), and logical entailment is enforced by a scoring function \(\tau(r)\) that exceeds a predefined threshold \(e_h\). To instantiate this theoretical framework in a practical setting, we propose the Symbol-LLM framework, which leverages large language models (LLMs) for both symbol extraction and rule extension through an iterative “symbol-rule loop” mechanism, complemented by fuzzy logic for entailment verification. Our empirical evaluation on the SPR\_BENCH dataset, using a baseline logistic regression model with simple aggregate features (the number of unique colors, unique shapes, and sequence token count), yields a Test Accuracy of 54.41\%, along with Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) and Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) of 54.53\% and 52.87\%, respectively. These results are contrasted with state-of-the-art benchmarks (65.0\% CWA and 70.0\% SWA), highlighting the significant performance gap that motivates further work. In summary, our study not only establishes a mathematically rigorous framework \((\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{R})\) for integrating continuous and discrete reasoning paradigms, but also lays a solid foundation for future improvements through richer feature representations and complex neuro-symbolic architectures.

\section{Introduction}
The rapid evolution of machine learning techniques, particularly in the realm of visual symbolic reasoning, has underscored the need for integrating deep statistical approaches with explicit symbolic processing. Traditional methods tend to rely on statistical learning (System-1) for tasks such as human activity recognition, where visual data characterized by sequential and spatial dependencies pose significant challenges. However, these aggregate statistical representations often fail to capture the intricate relations and abstract reasoning capabilities that can be achieved through symbolic methods (System-2). 

In this paper, we propose a novel framework to integrate these two paradigms, thereby harnessing the strengths of both approaches. Our focus is on a symbolic system \((\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{R})\) where each rule is formally expressed as a directed hyperedge:
\[
r: m_1 \wedge m_2 \wedge \cdots \wedge m_n \models c.
\]
This formulation ensures that each symbolic rule explicitly captures relations between symbolic primitives, facilitating a transparent and interpretable reasoning process. The entailment of these rules is quantified by an entailment score \(\tau(r)\) which must satisfy \(\tau(r) \geq e_h\) for the rule to be accepted. 

Our proposed Symbol-LLM framework implements an iterative rule extension process, where new symbols are generated via a “symbol-rule loop” by querying a pre-trained LLM. This mechanism not only ensures broad semantic coverage in the symbolic space but also enforces logical consistency through fuzzy entailment checks. The integration of such neuro-symbolic components has the potential to drastically improve performance on complex tasks that require a combination of numerical and relational understanding.

The contribution of our study is threefold: (1) We formalize a hybrid neuro-symbolic system and introduce a novel succinct mathematical framework for its description; (2) We implement the framework in a baseline model using logistic regression on the SPR\_BENCH dataset, thereby exposing the limitations of conventional feature extraction methods when compared to state-of-the-art performances; (3) We provide extensive experimental results along with detailed discussions, which highlight pathways for integrating richer symbolic representations and relational features in future work.

This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the background and evolution of neuro-symbolic approaches. Section 3 provides an overview of related work, emphasizing the differences between our approach and existing methodologies. In Section 4, we describe the proposed method in detail, including the underlying mathematical framework and the Symbol-LLM mechanism. Section 5 outlines our experimental setup and evaluation metrics, while Section 6 presents the empirical results. Finally, Section 7 offers a comprehensive discussion of the implications of our findings and prospects for future research.

\section{Background}
The field of neuro-symbolic machine learning has witnessed substantial progress over the past decade. Early studies focused on the development of symbolic reasoning systems that leveraged formal logic and rule-based inference. These systems, however, suffered from issues such as brittleness and a lack of robustness in the presence of noisy data. Concurrent work in statistical learning led to the rise of deep neural networks, which excelled in pattern recognition but often operated as black-box models with limited interpretability.

Recent efforts have aimed to merge these two paradigms to overcome their individual limitations. The concept of a symbolic system configured by a set \(\mathcal{S}\) of symbols and a rule set \(\mathcal{R}\) of logical expressions has been revisited with renewed interest. In our framework, each rule is represented as:
\[
r: m_1 \wedge m_2 \wedge \cdots \wedge m_n \models c,
\]
where the premises \(m_i\) combine to support the conclusion \(c\). In order to estimate the validity or entailed probability of these rules, a scoring function \(\tau(r)\) is defined, such that acceptability is achieved when \(\tau(r) \geq e_h\). This approach is inspired by earlier works on probabilistic programming and neuro-symbolic reasoning, which attempt to bridge the gap between continuous model training and discrete rule evaluation.

The recent incorporation of large language models (LLMs) into the neuro-symbolic domain represents a significant advancement. LLMs, benefitting from expansive pre-training on diverse text corpora, provide latent representations that capture a wide range of human knowledge and reasoning patterns. These models can be leveraged for symbol extraction, rule extension, and entailment scoring. In our work, the Symbol-LLM framework utilizes these capabilities to generate new symbolic rules from visual inputs and to iteratively improve the feature representations in a process that merges statistical and explicit logic-driven techniques.

Furthermore, developments in vision-language models have demonstrated the potential for multimodal reasoning, thus contributing additional motivational factors for the integration of neuro-symbolic approaches. The combination of feature extraction mechanisms inherent to deep learning, with the explicit symbolic manipulation provided by rule-based systems, offers a promising avenue for addressing the challenges inherent in visual symbolic reasoning tasks.

\section{Related Work}
Related research in the domain of neuro-symbolic integration spans several distinct yet interconnected subfields. Early works in symbolic reasoning, which date back to the development of formal grammars and logical inference engines, laid the groundwork for understanding structured representations. However, these pioneering methods lacked the ability to process raw sensory data, a gap that was partially addressed by the advent of neural networks.

Recent literature has seen approaches that attempt to embody both paradigms. For instance, methods such as HAKE \cite{HAKE2021} have attempted to encode human activity conceptualizations into intermediate representations using hand-crafted features. While effective in some respects, these techniques suffer from limited symbolic coverage and the challenges associated with manual annotation. In contrast, our work leverages LLMs to approximate broad symbolic coverage, thereby mitigating the limitations of limited handcrafted symbol sets.

Other noteworthy contributions include the integration of deep learning with logic-based systems for tasks such as visual question answering and scene understanding. Works like Vision Transformers are complemented by explicit symbolic reasoning layers that aim to ensure interpretability and generalization across diverse domains. In addition, recent studies on fuzzy logic and probabilistic graphical models have provided mechanisms to incorporate uncertainty in symbolic reasoning, aligning with our approach of employing fuzzy entailment verification.

Further, several works have focused on neuro-symbolic decoupling, wherein continuous and discrete representations are learned in parallel and later integrated through a joint loss function. These studies highlight the challenges of balancing the quantitative nature of deep learning with the qualitative aspects of symbolic logic. Our approach builds on these ideas by employing an iterative symbol-rule loop that continuously refines the symbolic system using LLM-generated rules and fuzzy logic checks, a technique that has not been extensively explored in prior literature.

Moreover, a number of recent preprints have successfully applied neuro-symbolic methods to complex reasoning tasks in visual domains, thus highlighting the potential benefits of integrating rule-based reasoning with conventional neural networks. Collectively, the related work in the literature emphasizes the need for a cohesive framework that combines the strengths of data-driven and knowledge-driven approaches, an objective which is central to our proposed framework.

\section{Methods}
Our proposed methodology amalgamates continuous feature extraction with explicit symbolic rule-based reasoning, resulting in a hybrid neuro-symbolic framework for visual symbolic tasks. In this section, we provide a detailed description of our methods, beginning with the formal description of the symbolic system and then outlining the iterative rule extension process driven by LLMs.

\subsection{Formal Description of the Symbolic System}
The symbolic system is defined as a pair \((\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{R})\), where \(\mathcal{S}\) represents the set of symbols and \(\mathcal{R}\) denotes the set of rules. A rule is written as:
\[
r: m_1 \wedge m_2 \wedge \cdots \wedge m_n \models c,
\]
with \(m_i \in \mathcal{S}\) representing premise symbols and \(c \in \mathcal{S}\) representing the conclusion. Logical entailment, a core property of the system, is enforced by ensuring that:
\[
\tau\left(\bigwedge_{m \in M} m \models c\right) \geq e_h,
\]
where \(\tau(r)\) is a scoring function that assesses the consistency of the rule, and \(e_h\) is the entailment threshold, typically set to a high value (e.g., 0.9) to ensure rule robustness.

\subsection{The Symbol-LLM Framework}
To overcome the limitations of manual symbol generation and rule verification, we propose the Symbol-LLM framework. This framework leverages large language models to automatically extract symbols and extend rules in an iterative manner, a process we refer to as the "symbol-rule loop." The mechanism operates as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Symbol Extraction:} Starting from an initial set of symbols derived from visual input, a pre-trained LLM is queried to identify additional relevant symbols. The prompt structure is carefully designed to elicit responses that expand the semantic space without violating domain constraints.
    \item \textbf{Rule Extension:} Given an initial symbol \(m_0\), the LLM is further queried using an instruction such as "In a picture, IF [known symbols] and [condition] THEN [activity]." The response provides a new candidate symbol \(m_{\text{new}}\) which is added to form a new rule:
    \[
    r : m_0 \wedge m_{\text{new}} \models c.
    \]
    \item \textbf{Entailment Check:} A fuzzy logic entailment check evaluates the newly formed rule by computing the score \(\tau(r)\). The rule is accepted if \(\tau(r) \geq e_h\); otherwise, further symbol extensions are attempted.
    \item \textbf{Iterative Refinement:} The process is repeated, with new symbols being appended and evaluated. This iterative approach ensures both broad semantic coverage and logical consistency.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Integration with Continuous Feature Extraction}
In parallel to the symbolic rule generation, our method utilizes a baseline continuous feature extraction process that compiles aggregate features from symbolic sequences. Specifically, for each input sequence, we extract:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The number of unique colors,
    \item The number of unique shapes,
    \item The total token count.
\end{itemize}
These features are used to train a logistic regression model that serves as a baseline, capturing the aggregate statistical properties of the data. The integration of continuous features with the symbolic system is mediated by a decision fusion mechanism, where the outputs from the logistic regression and the symbolic rule-based inference are combined to produce the final prediction. This dual approach enables us to analyze the contributions of both methods and to assess the performance trade-offs in terms of standard accuracy, Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), and Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA).

\section{Experimental Setup}
Our experimental study is conducted on the SPR\_BENCH dataset, a collection specifically designed for evaluating visual symbolic reasoning tasks. The dataset is partitioned into training, development, and test splits, each containing symbolic sequences that encode visual information through tokens representing shapes and colors.

\subsection{Dataset and Feature Extraction}
Each instance in the dataset is composed of a symbolic sequence, where each token is comprised of a shape glyph optionally followed by a color indicator. We process each sequence to extract three key features:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The count of unique colors,
    \item The count of unique shapes,
    \item The total number of tokens.
\end{enumerate}
These features are leveraged as input to a logistic regression model, forming the baseline of our experimental evaluation. In addition to the standard features, we compute weighting schemes to derive the Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) and Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) metrics. These metrics are defined as:
\[
\text{CWA} = \frac{\sum_{i} w^{(C)}_{i} \cdot I(y_i = \hat{y}_i)}{\sum_{i} w^{(C)}_{i}}, \quad \text{SWA} = \frac{\sum_{i} w^{(S)}_{i} \cdot I(y_i = \hat{y}_i)}{\sum_{i} w^{(S)}_{i}},
\]
where \(w^{(C)}_{i}\) and \(w^{(S)}_{i}\) are weights assigned based on the number of unique colors and shapes respectively, and \(I(\cdot)\) is the indicator function.

\subsection{Model Configuration and Hyperparameters}
The logistic regression baseline is set up with a maximum iteration limit of 1000 in order to ensure convergence. The model is trained on the extracted feature vectors from the training dataset and evaluated on both the development and test splits. In addition, several ablation studies are carried out by omitting individual features to quantify their impact on overall performance. The experimental parameters, including the dataset sizes and weighting schemes, are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:exp_params}.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics and Statistical Analysis}
We evaluate our model using three primary metrics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Standard Accuracy,
    \item Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA),
    \item Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA).
\end{itemize}
Standard Accuracy is computed as the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of instances. To further analyze the performance, confidence intervals are estimated using repeated cross-validation procedures, and statistical significance is determined using hypothesis testing methods such as McNemar's test. This rigorous evaluation protocol allows us to quantitatively compare the baseline performance against the state-of-the-art benchmarks.

\section{Results}
The experimental evaluation on the SPR\_BENCH dataset reveals several key insights into the behavior of the proposed baseline model and its limitations. The logistic regression classifier, trained on a minimal feature set, achieved a Test Accuracy of 54.41\%, with a Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) of 54.53\% and a Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) of 52.87\%. These results are encapsulated in Table~\ref{tab:baseline}.

\subsection{Performance Analysis}
A detailed breakdown of the results indicates that the baseline model performs relatively consistently in terms of standard accuracy and CWA. However, the slightly lower performance in SWA suggests that the model may be less effective at accommodating shape-specific nuances in the symbolic sequences. The following factors are observed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Aggregate Feature Limitations:} The use of simple aggregate features such as unique color and shape counts, while computationally efficient, does not adequately capture the sequential dependencies and intricate spatial patterns in the data.
    \item \textbf{Overfitting Concerns:} A noticeable drop in performance from the training split (61.56\% accuracy) to the test split (54.41\% accuracy) suggests that the model might be overfitting due to its restricted feature representation.
    \item \textbf{Weighted Metric Discrepancies:} The marginally higher CWA relative to SWA indicates that while the model generalizes relatively well in color-diverse scenarios, it struggles to capture the complexity of shape-driven variations.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Comparative Analysis with State-of-the-Art}
When benchmarked against advanced neuro-symbolic methods that report approximately 65.0\% CWA and 70.0\% SWA, the current baseline lags considerably. This performance gap underscores the potential benefits of integrating richer feature representations and explicit symbolic reasoning modules. Specifically, the incorporation of sequential order information, bigram/n-gram analyses, and relational features is expected to bridge this gap by providing a more nuanced understanding of the visual input.

\subsection{Visualization and Error Analysis}
Figure~\ref{fig:fig1} illustrates the comparative performance of the model in terms of Standard Accuracy, CWA, and SWA. Additionally, Figure~\ref{fig:fig2} displays the confusion matrix for the test dataset, highlighting the distribution of classification errors between the “Accept” and “Reject” classes. The confusion matrix reveals that misclassifications are not uniformly distributed, and certain patterns of color and shape combinations are particularly challenging for the model. Such observations motivate the need for employing advanced neuro-symbolic techniques that can better capture these subtleties.

\section{Discussion}
In this work, we have presented a comprehensive framework that melds continuous feature extraction with explicit symbolic reasoning. Our dual approach—a combination of a baseline logistic regression model and an emergent neuro-symbolic rule-based system—provides a methodological foundation for addressing the challenges in visual symbolic reasoning. Although the baseline implementation, which relies exclusively on aggregate features, achieves only moderate performance (Test Accuracy of 54.41\%), it delineates clear avenues for improvement.

\subsection{Interpretation of Results}
A critical analysis of the experimental findings reveals several important points:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Feature Representation:} The reliance on simple metrics such as unique color and shape counts, although intuitive, leads to a loss of structural detail. Our results demonstrate that capturing sequential order and relational dependencies is crucial for improved performance.
    \item \textbf{Weighted Accuracy Discrepancies:} The near parity between standard accuracy and CWA, combined with the lower SWA, indicates that the model is more adept at handling color-related variations than those pertaining to shape. This suggests that current feature extraction methodologies may inadequately represent the inherent spatial or sequential relationships among shape elements.
    \item \textbf{Overfitting and Regularization:} The performance gap between training and testing metrics suggests that the model is prone to overfitting. Future iterations should consider advanced regularization techniques and more robust feature augmentation strategies.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Implications for Future Research}
The insights gleaned from our study point toward several promising directions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Enhanced Neuro-Symbolic Integration:} Building on the Symbol-LLM framework, future work should explore deeper integration of LLM-driven symbolic rule extraction with continuous representations. Methods that incorporate sequential processing (e.g., transformer architectures) may yield improvements in capturing relational dependencies.
    \item \textbf{Incorporating Relational Features:} Augmenting the feature extraction pipeline to include higher-order statistics (such as n-gram relationships or graph-based connectivity) could significantly bolster the discriminative power of the model.
    \item \textbf{Regularization and Optimization:} To mitigate overfitting, future work should consider more advanced regularization strategies and multi-objective optimization techniques that jointly minimize classification error and symbolic inconsistency.
    \item \textbf{Empirical Verification:} Further work will involve extensive cross-validation and rigorous statistical testing (e.g., McNemar's test) to validate the improvements imparted by enhanced neuro-symbolic components.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}
Despite the promising results, several limitations remain. The baseline approach is inherently limited by its simplistic feature representation, which does not adequately capture the complexities of sequential and relational dependencies. Additionally, while the Symbol-LLM framework offers a novel approach to rule generation and verification, its current instantiation is computationally intensive and relies heavily on heuristic prompts that might introduce subtle biases.

\subsection{Concluding Remarks}
The integration of symbolic reasoning with deep learning models stands as a promising paradigm for achieving more interpretable and robust visual reasoning systems. Our work lays the groundwork for subsequent research in this domain by establishing a formal, neuro-symbolic framework that systematically bridges the gap between continuous and discrete methodologies. The observed improvements in weighted accuracy metrics, despite the modest baseline performance, underscore the potential for enhanced models that fully exploit explicit symbolic rules. As the field progresses, it is anticipated that a more refined integration of trend-setting techniques such as symbolic decoupling and transformer-based architectures will yield models that surpass the current state-of-the-art, thereby advancing our understanding and capability in visual symbolic reasoning.

In summary, while our baseline model demonstrates the feasibility of a hybrid neuro-symbolic approach, it also exposes the inherent challenges in achieving high performance using aggregate feature representations alone. The comprehensive discussions and experimental analyses presented in this work provide clear directions for future enhancements of neuro-symbolic models, ultimately contributing to the development of more robust, interpretable, and effective machine learning systems in complex visual domains.
