# Hybrid Transformer-Graph-DP Model for SPR

This repository contains the implementation and experimental framework for our research on a Hybrid Transformer-Graph-DP model for Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR) with Differentiable Predicate Dynamics. Our approach integrates transformer-based embeddings, graph self-attention mechanisms, and a differentiable dynamic programming (DP) module to induce latent predicate dynamics and achieves both high predictive performance and model interpretability.

## Overview

Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR) tasks require models that can extract and reason over latent rules in sequential data. In this work, we bridge neural representation learning and symbolic reasoning by integrating:

- **Transformer-based Embeddings:** Capturing local and sequential dependencies.
- **Graph Self-Attention:** Refining token representations via weighted aggregation over tokens.
- **Differentiable Dynamic Programming (DP):** Enumerating candidate predicates in a smooth, gradient-optimized manner to emulate combinatorial rule induction.

The network is trained end-to-end using a binary cross-entropy loss:
  
  L = - (1/N) ∑[yᵢ log(ŷᵢ) + (1 - yᵢ) log(1 - ŷᵢ)],

where yᵢ and ŷᵢ are the ground truth and predicted labels respectively.

---

## Architecture and Methodology

The core components of our model are:

1. **Dual-Aspect Token Embeddings:** Each token is endowed with features (e.g., shape and color) that are concatenated and processed.
2. **Transformer Encoder:** Computes multi-head self-attention, where the attention is given by:
  
    A = softmax((Q * Kᵀ) / √dₖ)

   to capture long-range dependencies.

3. **Graph Self-Attention Module:** Interprets attention weights as edges in a graph and performs graph convolution:

    H = ReLU(A * X * W_g)

   where X is the transformer output.
  
4. **Differentiable Dynamic Programming Module:** Aggregates evidence via a pooling operation to compute candidate predicate scores:

    s = σ(W_dp * f + b_dp)

   where σ is the sigmoid activation, and the final decision is the result of a learned gating mechanism, effectively emulating a logical AND over candidate predicates.

### Key Equations

- **Binary Cross Entropy Loss:**

  L = - (1/N) ∑[yᵢ log(ŷᵢ) + (1 - yᵢ) log(1 - ŷᵢ)]

- **Self-Attention:**

  A = softmax((X * Xᵀ) / √d)

- **Dynamic Programming Scoring:**

  s = σ(W_dp * f + b_dp)

## Dataset and Preprocessing

Our experiments use the SPR_BENCH dataset, where each sample consists of a sequential symbolic data instance with associated token features (e.g., shape and color). For rapid prototyping, a subsampled dataset with 1,000 training examples and 200 validation examples is provided.

_A few preprocessing notes:_
- **Tokenization and Normalization:** Custom pipelines ensure that shape and color features are consistently transformed into embedding indices.
- **Balanced Splits:** Stratified sampling is applied to maintain a balanced distribution of labels across training, validation, and test splits.

Please refer to the `data/` directory for scripts on dataset loading and preprocessing.

## Usage

### Training the Model

Use the provided training script to start the model training:

```
python train.py --config configs/config.yaml
```

The configuration file (`config.yaml`) contains parameters such as:
- Embedding dimensions
- Number of heads in the transformer encoder
- Dropout probabilities
- Learning rate and optimization settings
- Number of candidate predicates in the DP module

### Running Inference

After training, run the inference script to evaluate the model on the test set:

```
python evaluate.py --model_path models/best_model.pth --data_path data/test_set.json
```

### Visualization

For detailed interpretability, the repository includes scripts for visualizing self-attention heatmaps and dynamic programming score trajectories:

```
python visualize_attention.py --model_path models/best_model.pth --sample_index 10
python visualize_dp_scores.py --log_dir logs/
```

## Experimental Setup

- **Hardware:** Experiments were conducted primarily on CPU-only systems (ensuring compatibility with resource-constrained environments).
- **Optimizer:** Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-3.
- **Batch Size/Epochs:** Batch size set to 32, trained over 5 epochs with early stopping based on development set performance.
- **Ablation Studies:** The code includes options to disable individual modules (graph attention or DP module) to assess performance contributions.

For full details on the experimental settings, refer to `experiments/experiment_details.md`.

## Results and Visualizations

Our model achieves:
- A test Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) of **68.85%**.
- An absolute improvement of **3.85%** over the baseline SWA of **65.0%**.
- A low performance variability (±0.5% standard deviation over multiple runs).

### Example Visualizations

- **Self-Attention Heatmaps:** Demonstrate that the transformer correctly identifies semantically important token relationships.
- **DP Score Trajectories:** Show convergence of candidate predicate scores over training epochs, illustrating the differentiable approximation of combinatorial rules.

Results are summarized in the repository’s `results/` folder, which contains plots and a comprehensive performance report.
