Preparing features using TfidfVectorizer on the symbolic sequences.

Training Decision Tree Classifier on the training data and tuning on dev split.

Experiment 1: Evaluation on Decision Tree Classifier with SWA metric
This experiment demonstrates the model's performance using Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA),
which weights each sample by the count of unique shape types (first character of each token) found in the sequence.
Higher SWA indicates better handling of the intrinsic symbolic structure of the sequence.

SWA on Training Data: 0.8748
SWA on Development Data: 0.6929
SWA on Test Data: 0.6814

Experiment 2: Generating Figure_1.png to show the confusion matrix for the Development split.

Experiment 3: Generating Figure_2.png to illustrate distribution of shape variety weights on the Development split.

All experiments are complete. Figures saved as Figure_1.png and Figure_2.png.
