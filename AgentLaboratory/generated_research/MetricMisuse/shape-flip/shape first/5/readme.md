# Advanced Approaches for Symbolic Pattern Recognition

Welcome to the repository for our research on advanced symbolic pattern recognition using neuro-symbolic techniques. This project investigates the challenge of extracting latent symbolic dependencies from token sequences on the SPR_BENCH dataset. The approach integrates classical feature-based models with explicit rule extraction and refinement—leveraging large language models (LLMs) for candidate rule generation and inductive logic programming (ILP) for rule validation—to bridge the performance gap inherent in conventional methods.

## Overview

This repository contains code, experiments, and documentation for our work on symbolic pattern recognition (SPR). Our baseline approach is built on a simple logistic regression model that uses a feature mapping based on:

- **Shape Variety:** The number of unique shapes (derived from token first characters).
- **Color Variety:** Diversity derived from token-based color indicators.
- **Token Count:** The total number of tokens in a sequence.

Despite achieving a modest Test Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) of about 55.32%, these surface-level features fail to capture the nonlinear and chained dependencies central to SPR tasks. Our research introduces a neuro-symbolic framework that augments such models with explicit rule extraction and iterative rule refinement processes.

---

## Motivation

Symbolic pattern recognition is critical in scenarios where latent symbolic relationships drive the behavior of complex systems (e.g., natural language processing, model-driven engineering). While classical models (like logistic regression and Random Forests) can capture superficial statistics, they are insufficient for understanding the deeper symbolic dependencies. Recent advances demonstrate that incorporating neuro-symbolic reasoning—using methods such as LLM-based candidate rule extraction followed by ILP—can raise SWA performance targets from around 55% to the desired 65–70% range.

## Approaches and Methodology

### Baseline Feature Extraction

The baseline consists of mapping each token sequence, s, to a feature vector:
  
  φ(s) = [shape variety, color variety, token count]

The classification function is defined as:

  f(x) = σ(wᵀx + b), with σ(z) = 1 / (1 + exp(–z))

Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) is computed via:

  SWA = [Σᵢ wᵢ • 1{yᵢ = ŷᵢ}]/[Σᵢ wᵢ]

where the weights wᵢ are based on the number of unique shape tokens in each sequence.

### Neuro-Symbolic Enhancements

To overcome the limitations of the baseline, we propose a two-tier process:

1. **Candidate Rule Extraction:**  
   Leverage a large language model (LLM) to generate candidate symbolic rules based on natural language descriptions of the token sequences.

2. **Rule Refinement via ILP:**  
   Employ inductive logic programming (ILP) to iteratively refine and validate the candidate rules for logical consistency.  
   
Successful candidate rules are then integrated into an expanded feature mapping:
  
  φ′(s) = [φ(s); ψ(s)]

Here, ψ(s) captures the binary activations of validated rules, leading to a hybrid model that integrates both surface-level features and higher-level symbolic abstractions.

## Experimental Setup

### Dataset

Our experiments are conducted on the SPR_BENCH dataset, which is split as follows:
  
- **Training:** 20,000 examples  
- **Validation:** 5,000 examples  
- **Test:** 10,000 examples

Each sample consists of an identifier, a token sequence, and a corresponding label. Feature extraction is performed by counting unique shapes (first characters), determining color variety (subsequent characters), and computing the total token count.

### Evaluation Metrics

Our primary metric is the Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA):

  SWA = [Σᵢ wᵢ • 1{yᵢ = ŷᵢ}]/[Σᵢ wᵢ]

Additional evaluations (e.g., confusion matrices, ablation studies) help diagnose systematic misclassifications and analyze the impact of each feature component.

### Hyperparameters and Implementation

Key settings include:

| Parameter                | Logistic Regression | Random Forest    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Maximum Iterations       | 1,000               | —                |
| Number of Estimators     | —                   | 100              |
| Random Seed              | 42                  | 42               |
| Feature Set              | [shape, color, count] | Same as LR       |
| Development SWA          | 53.57%              | 53.02%         |
| Test SWA                 | 55.32%              | 54.89%         |

Implementation is in Python, leveraging libraries such as scikit-learn and HuggingFace's datasets. Reproducibility is ensured with fixed random seeds across experiments.

## Results and Discussion

### Experimental Findings

- **Baseline Logistic Regression:**  
  - Development SWA: 53.57%  
  - Test SWA: 55.32%

- **Random Forest Classifier:**  
  - Development SWA: 53.02%  
  - Test SWA: 54.89%

Despite the successful extraction of some symbolic information from superficial features, these scores clearly illustrate the limitations of conventional feature-aggregation methods. The performance gap relative to state-of-the-art benchmarks (65–70% SWA) validates the need for our proposed neuro-symbolic approach.

### Analysis

- **Feature Impact:** Ablation studies confirm that shape variety, color variety, and token count each play a significant role. However, the inability to capture nonlinear interdependencies leads to systematic misclassifications.
- **Neuro-Symbolic Potential:** Integrating explicit rule extraction and refinement promises improvements both in SWA and in model interpretability, as the logical structure of token sequences is rendered more explicit.
- **Future Directions:** Our ongoing work focuses on deeper architectures (e.g., CNNs, RNNs, and graph neural networks) combined with iterative neuro-symbolic feedback loops to further close the performance gap.
