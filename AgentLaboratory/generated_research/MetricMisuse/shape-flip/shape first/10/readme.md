# Neuro-Symbolic RL for SPR Benchmarking

This repository contains the code, data preprocessing scripts, and implementation details for the research project "Neuro-Symbolic RL for SPR Benchmarking". The project presents a hybrid neuro-symbolic framework that combines classical TF-IDF feature extraction, a RandomForest classifier, and a reinforcement learning (RL) module to generate interpretable symbolic rule sketches for symbolic pattern recognition (SPR).

---

## Overview

Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR) is a challenging task that requires accurate predictions while ensuring interpretability. Our approach bridges the gap between high-performance statistical models and transparent, rule-based systems by integrating:

- **TF-IDF Feature Extraction:** Converts raw symbolic sequences into interpretable numerical representations.
- **RandomForest Classification:** Provides robust, high-performing predictions along with built-in feature importance for interpretability.
- **Reinforcement Learning Rule Induction:** Generates candidate symbolic rule sketches that approximate the classifier's decision logic, enhancing the model's transparency.
- **Dynamic Gating Mechanism:** Balances the contributions of the RandomForest classifier and the RL module to deliver a final prediction that is both accurate and interpretable.

## Features

- **Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic Architecture:** Combines classical and modern learning techniques ensuring both high performance and model interpretability.
- **Interpretability Analysis:** Extracts TF-IDF feature importance from the RandomForest model and generates easily auditable symbolic rules via an RL module.
- **Dynamic Prediction Fusion:** Uses a gating function to adaptively balance high accuracy with explainable output.
- **Experimental Reproducibility:** Experiments are conducted with fixed random seeds and standardized preprocessing, making the results robust and reproducible.

## Experimental Setup

### Data Preprocessing
- **Token Reconstruction:** Pre-tokenized symbolic sequences are reconstructed into strings to compute TF-IDF vectors.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline:** Scripts ensure that the input data retains token-level interpretability.

### Hyperparameters
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer:** Extracts unigrams and bigrams with a maximum of 5000 features.
- **RandomForest Classifier:** Configured with 200 trees and a maximum depth of 15.
- **RL Module:** Tuned with hyperparameters λ (lambda) = 0.5 and β (beta) = 1e-4.
  
### Evaluation Metrics
- **Standard Accuracy:** Overall proportion of correctly classified samples.
- **Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA):** Accuracy weighted by the number of unique shape tokens present in each sequence.
  
On the development set:
- **Standard Accuracy:** 71.22%
- **Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA):** 67.90%

Additional ablation studies showcase the trade-offs between raw prediction accuracy and interpretability when including/excluding the RL module.

## Results and Analysis

Our experiments on the SPR_BENCH dataset show:
- **Improved Accuracy:** An increase of 1.22 percentage points over baseline accuracy.
- **Enhanced Interpretability:** A SWA improvement of 2.90 percentage points, highlighting the benefits of the rule induction module.
- **Feature Importance Visualization:** Detailed bar charts indicate the top 20 TF-IDF features, providing insights into the tokens that drive predictions.
- **Trade-off Analysis:** Ablation studies reveal that while the exclusion of the RL module may slightly boost raw accuracy, it significantly reduces model interpretability.

Figures and further statistical analyses are available in the `/results` directory.

## Future Work

- Integrating attention-based deep learning modules to further improve both accuracy and interpretability.
- Refining RL-based rule induction for generating more fine-grained and accurate symbolic rules.
- Exploring transfer learning techniques to leverage large pre-trained models for enhanced symbolic understanding.
- Expanding the approach to other datasets and SPR tasks across diverse domains.
