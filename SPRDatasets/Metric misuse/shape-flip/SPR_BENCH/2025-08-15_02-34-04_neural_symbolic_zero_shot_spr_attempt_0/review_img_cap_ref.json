        "Img_description": "The provided image is a placeholder with the text 'main_multisub.png', and no graphical content is available for analysis.",
        "Img_review": "The image does not contain any graphical content, making it impossible to evaluate design elements like axes, labels, curves, or legends. A rendered figure is necessary for proper analysis and critique.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption provides a concise summary of the intended purpose of the figure, describing training/validation performance vs. zero-shot results across ablations and noting the observed performance gap. However, without the actual figure, it is impossible to confirm the accuracy or adequacy of this description. The caption could benefit from explicitly mentioning the axes or key trends (if present) for additional clarity.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure adequately, explaining the context (training on synthetic data, testing on held-out configurations) and the observed phenomena (high in-domain accuracy but poor zero-shot performance). The text also connects the figure to the impact of random token masking. However, the absence of the actual figure limits the ability to evaluate how well the references align with the visual content."

        "Img_description": "The image is a placeholder containing only the text 'random_token_mask_15.png'. No data visualization or meaningful content is provided.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is missing, as the image is a placeholder with no actual content. To support the claims of the paper, the authors must include the appropriate figure showing the exacerbated performance drop under random masking. Without it, the figure fails to provide any informative value.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption ('Exacerbated performance drop under random masking') cannot be evaluated because the figure is missing. The caption appears to describe an intended trend or result but provides no concise insight without the corresponding visualization.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references to Figure 2 cannot be evaluated meaningfully because the figure itself is missing. The references ('Figure 2 shows how random token masking severely degrades performance.') seem to align with the intended purpose of the figure but remain uninformative in the absence of the actual figure."

    "figure_3": {
        "Img_description": "The image consists of two blank panels side by side, with no data points, axes labels, legends, or other meaningful visual content.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is entirely blank and does not convey any information. It fails to illustrate the comparison between frozen embeddings and one-hot representations, as described in the caption and main text references. Suggestions for improvement include adding meaningful data visualizations, labeling axes, including a legend, and ensuring the figure aligns with the caption and main text.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption, while concise, does not align with the figure. It describes a comparison that is not visually represented, making it irrelevant in the figure's current state. The caption should summarize insights derived from actual data, which is missing.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references describe the intended purpose of the figure but fail to integrate effectively due to the figure's lack of content. Without meaningful visual representation, the references cannot fulfill their explanatory role."
