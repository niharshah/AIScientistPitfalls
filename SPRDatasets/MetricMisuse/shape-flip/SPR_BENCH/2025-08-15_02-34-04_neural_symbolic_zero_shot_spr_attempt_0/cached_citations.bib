% The paper 'Dynamic Neuro-Symbolic Knowledge Graph Construction for Zero-shot Commonsense Question Answering' presents a neuro-symbolic approach for zero-shot reasoning by dynamically generating commonsense knowledge graphs. This aligns with the proposed study's focus on neuro-symbolic integration for zero-shot learning in SPR. It is particularly relevant for summarizing prior work on neural-symbolic integration and supporting the argument for the feasibility of zero-shot reasoning frameworks.

% The paper 'Standard Neural Computation Alone Is Insufficient for Logical Intelligence' highlights limitations of neural networks in rule-based reasoning and logical inference, advocating for new paradigms like Logical Neural Units. This aligns with the study's focus on addressing gaps in neural network capabilities for rule-based reasoning through neuro-symbolic integration. It should be cited in the discussion of research gaps and the motivation for combining neural and symbolic reasoning frameworks.
