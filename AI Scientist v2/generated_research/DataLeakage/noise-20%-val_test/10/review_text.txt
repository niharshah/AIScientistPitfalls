    "Summary": "The paper explores the real-world challenges of deploying a hybrid deep learning model for text classification, which combines pre-trained embeddings with a lightweight domain classifier. The study highlights issues like overfitting and inconclusive gains, with the goal of encouraging transparent reporting of negative results.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper emphasizes the importance of reporting negative or inconclusive outcomes, which is valuable for scientific rigor.",
        "The authors identify overfitting tendencies and highlight the challenges of deploying hybrid models in real-world scenarios."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper lacks novelty. The proposed hybrid architecture and its approach to integrating pre-trained embeddings with domain-specific modules are standard and do not introduce new techniques.",
        "The results are marginal and inconclusive, with a 0.9% improvement in Macro-F1 score that does not provide sufficient evidence of meaningful contributions.",
        "The experimental setup is poorly described. The dataset is proprietary, and critical details like data size, splits, and preprocessing steps are missing, making it difficult to evaluate reproducibility.",
        "Key methodological details, such as architecture specifics, hyperparameter settings, and training strategies, are relegated to the appendix, undermining the paper's clarity.",
        "Missing references and placeholders (e.g., [**?**]) suggest a lack of rigor in literature review and citation practices.",
        "The paper fails to provide actionable insights or recommendations beyond general suggestions about regularization and data augmentation."

    "Questions": [
        "What are the exact details of the proprietary dataset (e.g., data size, class distribution, preprocessing steps)?",
        "Can the authors provide more specifics about the architecture and hyperparameter settings beyond what is mentioned in the appendix?",
        "Why are critical citations missing and replaced with placeholders (e.g., [**?**])?",
        "What specific regularization or data augmentation strategies would the authors recommend based on their findings?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The authors do not adequately address the limitations of using a proprietary dataset, which impedes reproducibility.",
        "The analysis of overfitting and inconclusive gains is superficial and does not lead to meaningful conclusions or alternative approaches."
