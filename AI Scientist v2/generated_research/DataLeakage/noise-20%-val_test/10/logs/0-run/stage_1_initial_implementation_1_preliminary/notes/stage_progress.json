  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Baseline Design**: Successful experiments began with a solid and compact baseline. This typically involved loading the SPR_BENCH dataset, building a character-level vocabulary, and encoding sequences as integer lists. The use of small bi-directional LSTM or GRU models with mean-pooled hidden states feeding into a linear classifier was common. This design choice provided a balance between simplicity and interpretability.\n\n- **Training and Evaluation**: Training was conducted using the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss, with metrics such as loss and Macro-F1 tracked across epochs. Successful experiments often trained for a limited number of epochs (e.g., five) and used dynamic padding in the dataloader to handle variable-length sequences efficiently.\n\n- **Interpretability and Reproducibility**: A focus on interpretability was evident, with embedding matrices saved for downstream analysis and rule extraction. Successful experiments also ensured reproducibility by storing metrics, predictions, and learning curves in a structured format.\n\n- **Efficient Execution**: The experiments were designed to run efficiently on both CPU and GPU, with appropriate handling of device transfers for models and data. This ensured that experiments could be executed without excessive computational overhead.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Dataset Availability**: A frequent cause of failure was the absence of necessary dataset files, leading to `FileNotFoundError`. This highlights the importance of verifying dataset paths and ensuring all required files are present before execution.\n\n- **Module Import Errors**: Another common issue was `ModuleNotFoundError` due to missing or incorrectly referenced modules like `SPR.py`. This underscores the need for careful management of script dependencies and ensuring all necessary modules are accessible.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Dataset Management**: Ensure that all dataset files are correctly placed in the expected directory structure before running experiments. Consider implementing checks at the start of the script to verify the presence of these files and provide informative error messages if they are missing.\n\n- **Dependency Handling**: Maintain a clear and organized directory structure for scripts and modules. Use relative imports or update the Python path dynamically to ensure all necessary modules are accessible during execution.\n\n- **Baseline Iteration**: Start with a simple and interpretable baseline, as demonstrated in successful experiments. Once a working baseline is established, iteratively introduce more complex models or rule-extraction mechanisms to improve performance while maintaining interpretability.\n\n- **Performance Monitoring**: Continue to track key metrics such as loss and Macro-F1 across training and validation sets. Use these metrics to identify overfitting or underfitting and adjust model complexity or training duration accordingly.\n\n- **Focus on Interpretability**: Maintain a focus on interpretability by saving model components like embedding matrices and visualizing them to understand the model's decision-making process. This can also aid in extracting rules or insights from the model.\n\nBy adhering to these recommendations and learning from both successful and failed experiments, future research can build on existing progress to achieve improved performance and deeper insights."
