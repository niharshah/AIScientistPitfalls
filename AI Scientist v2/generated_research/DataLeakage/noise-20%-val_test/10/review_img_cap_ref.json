    "figure_1": {
        "Img_description": "The figure comprises two subplots labeled (a) and (b), each displaying a placeholder with the filenames 'performance.png' and 'baseline_loss.png' instead of actual graphical content. No axes, data points, or legends are visible.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is incomplete as it only contains placeholders instead of actual plots. Essential elements like axes, legends, and data are missing, making it impossible to analyze or draw conclusions. The authors should replace placeholders with meaningful plots and ensure all necessary elements for interpretation are included.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption claims 'Baseline behavior showing stable yet plateaued performance,' but this cannot be verified due to the lack of actual data in the figure. While concise, the caption is speculative in its current form and needs revision to accurately reflect the figure once the plots are added.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text reference '[]' is either incomplete or a placeholder. It does not provide any meaningful context or explanation for the figure. The authors should ensure the figure is properly referenced and integrated into the text, with clear connections to its purpose and content."
    },
    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The figure consists of two subplots. The left subplot, labeled 'loss_and_f1.png,' likely shows trends in loss and F1 score over training epochs. The right subplot, labeled 'hybrid_test_macro_f1.png,' appears to depict macro F1 scores on a test dataset. However, both subplots lack axis labels, legends, and gridlines, making interpretation difficult.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is poorly presented due to the absence of axis labels, legends, and gridlines. These omissions make it challenging to understand what the plots are showing or to validate any claims. Adding these elements would significantly improve the figure's clarity and utility. The figure also does not provide sufficient evidence to support the caption's claim about inconclusive gains.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption is concise but too vague. It fails to describe the specific metrics or trends shown in the figure and does not provide sufficient context for the term 'inconclusive gains.' A more detailed caption would help readers better understand the figure's purpose and relevance.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references are entirely missing ('[]'), leaving the figure disconnected from the paper's narrative. The lack of figrefs prevents readers from understanding the context or importance of the figure. The main text should explicitly describe the figure, explaining its content, purpose, and connection to the paper's arguments."
    },
    "figure_3": {
        "Img_description": "The image contains placeholder text reading 'baseline_confusion_matrix.png' instead of an actual confusion matrix or visual data.",
        "Img_review": "The figure does not contain any substantive content to analyze. The intended confusion matrix is missing, and placeholder text has been provided instead. This is a critical issue, as the figure cannot be evaluated in its current form. The authors should replace this placeholder with the actual confusion matrix visualization.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption 'Baseline confusion matrix on the test set' is generic and could potentially describe a confusion matrix if one were present. However, since the figure is missing, it is impossible to determine if the caption effectively summarizes the data or insights. The caption could be improved by including a brief summary of key findings from the confusion matrix once the figure is added.",
        "Figrefs_review": "No references to the figure are provided in the main text, as indicated by the empty bracket []. Even if references were present, they would not be meaningful without the actual figure. The authors should ensure the figure is properly included and referenced in the text, with discussion of its content and relevance."
