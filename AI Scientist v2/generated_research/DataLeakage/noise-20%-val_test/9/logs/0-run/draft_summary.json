  "Experiment_description": "Experiments involved creating baseline models using logistic regression in PyTorch for SPR sequences. Each model focused on interpretability and rule extraction, with performance evaluated on validation and test datasets.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are important for establishing interpretable baseline models that combine symbolic and neural methods, paving the way for more complex neuro-symbolic models in future research. The findings highlight the potential and limitations of logistic regression for sequence prediction tasks.",
  "Description": "The methods involved training logistic regression models on bag-of-characters representations of SPR sequences. Models were evaluated on their ability to generalize, with metrics such as accuracy and rule-based accuracy tracked. Issues like overfitting and class imbalance were observed, providing insights for model improvement.",
