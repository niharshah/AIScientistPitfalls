        "Caption_review": "The caption claims 'near-perfect classification,' but this cannot be verified due to the absence of the actual figure. The caption is concise, but its accuracy and alignment with the figure cannot be assessed.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure and claims it depicts a near-diagonal confusion matrix with near-perfect classification. However, this alignment cannot be evaluated due to the placeholder image. The references in the text are descriptive enough but require the actual figure to confirm their adequacy."
