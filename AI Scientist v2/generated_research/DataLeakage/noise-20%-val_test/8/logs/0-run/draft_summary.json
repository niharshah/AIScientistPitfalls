  "Experiment_description": "The experiments focus on implementing shallow decision-tree classifiers using different feature representations of symbolic sequences to ensure model interpretability through decision-rule paths. Various approaches, including token count vectors and bag-of-character n-grams, were explored.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are crucial in setting a baseline for interpretable machine learning models in symbolic sequence classification. The findings highlight the balance required between achieving high accuracy and maintaining model interpretability. They serve as a foundation for refining models to enhance generalization without compromising interpretability.",
  "Description": "The methodologies involved loading datasets, vectorizing sequences into feature vectors, training shallow decision-tree classifiers, and evaluating performance using Self-Explain Fidelity Accuracy (SEFA). The experiments included training on both real and synthetic datasets, with a focus on extracting interpretable decision rules.",
