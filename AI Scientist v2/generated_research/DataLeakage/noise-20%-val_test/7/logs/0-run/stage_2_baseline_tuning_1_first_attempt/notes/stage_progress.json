  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Baseline Model and Vectorization**: The use of a simple two-layer PyTorch MLP with character 3-gram count features as input provided a solid baseline that was both performant and interpretable. This approach consistently achieved high accuracy and fidelity across various hyperparameter tuning experiments.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic exploration of hyperparameters such as epochs, learning rate, batch size, weight decay, dropout probability, hidden dimensions, and number of hidden layers led to improved model performance. The experiments demonstrated that careful tuning of these parameters could achieve perfect validation and test accuracy, as well as perfect rule fidelity.\n\n- **Decision Tree Distillation**: Extracting rules through a DecisionTreeClassifier to mimic the network\u2019s predictions proved effective. This method consistently resulted in high rule fidelity, indicating that the decision tree captured the model's behavior well.\n\n- **Data Management and Logging**: Consistent logging of metrics, losses, and predictions, along with saving experiment data to a structured format (experiment_data.npy), facilitated thorough analysis and reproducibility of results.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Ambiguous Truth Value Checks**: The failed experiment on n-gram range tuning highlighted a common pitfall in handling numpy arrays. Direct truth value checks on numpy arrays can lead to ValueErrors due to ambiguity. This issue can be avoided by explicitly checking the length of the array or using numpy-specific functions to assess emptiness.\n\n- **Dataset Availability**: Several experiments had to use synthetic datasets due to the unavailability of the original SPR_BENCH dataset. Ensuring access to the intended dataset is crucial for the validity and applicability of experimental results.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Baseline with Advanced Techniques**: While the current baseline is effective, future experiments could incorporate richer symbolic encodings or neuro-symbolic regularization to potentially enhance performance further.\n\n- **Expand Hyperparameter Search Space**: Consider exploring a wider range of hyperparameters and more complex architectures, such as deeper networks or different activation functions, to uncover additional performance improvements.\n\n- **Improve Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling and validation checks, especially when dealing with numpy arrays or other data structures that may have ambiguous truth values.\n\n- **Ensure Dataset Accessibility**: Prioritize access to the intended datasets before starting experiments. If using synthetic data, ensure it is representative of the original dataset to maintain the relevance of the results.\n\n- **Leverage Experiment Data**: Utilize the comprehensive logging and saved experiment data for deeper analysis, such as identifying trends across different hyperparameter settings or understanding the impact of specific configurations on model performance.\n\nBy building on these insights and addressing the identified pitfalls, future experiments can achieve even greater success and contribute valuable findings to the field."
