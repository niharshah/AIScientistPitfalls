    "Summary": "The paper explores the limitations and challenges of model interpretability methods in real-world applications. It highlights issues such as instability, lack of robustness, and inconsistencies in interpretability outputs. The study primarily reports negative and inconclusive findings but does not propose novel solutions or methodologies to address the identified issues.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper tackles an important topic: the limitations of interpretability methods, which is often overlooked in the literature.",
        "It raises awareness about the challenges of applying interpretability methods in real-world contexts, such as noise, distribution shifts, and inconsistent results."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper lacks actionable contributions or novel theoretical insights. It focuses on highlighting pitfalls without proposing solutions or new methods.",
        "The experimental methodology is not described in sufficient detail to ensure reproducibility or to justify the claims made.",
        "There is a lack of clarity in the presentation, with vague descriptions of experiments and insufficient quantitative or qualitative results to support the findings.",
        "The paper does not propose any new benchmarks, evaluation protocols, or frameworks to standardize the testing of interpretability methods.",
        "Ethical considerations and potential negative societal impacts of unreliable interpretability are not sufficiently discussed."

    "Questions": [
        "Can the authors provide more detailed descriptions of the experiments, including datasets, models, and specific interpretability methods used?",
        "What steps were taken to ensure reproducibility of the negative findings?",
        "Why were no solutions, benchmarks, or evaluation protocols proposed to address the identified issues?",
        "How do the authors suggest that the community should address the instability and inconsistency problems in interpretability methods?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper fails to propose solutions or actionable insights to address the identified issues. It also does not establish any new benchmarks or evaluation protocols.",
        "The lack of detailed experimental setups and results makes it difficult to verify the findings or draw meaningful conclusions.",
        "The discussion on the ethical implications of unreliable interpretability methods is superficial and needs elaboration."
