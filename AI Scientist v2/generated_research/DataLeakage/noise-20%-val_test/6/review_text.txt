    "Summary": "The paper investigates performance stagnation in neural networks, particularly in modern architectures. It documents repeated failures to surpass baseline performance despite employing various modifications, such as residual connections, regularization, and data augmentation. The authors argue that these findings highlight the need to publish negative results and propose guidelines to detect and mitigate similar plateaus in the future.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses an important problem of performance stagnation, which has practical implications for the research community.",
        "Promotes the value of publishing negative or inconclusive results to improve research efficiency."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The methodology lacks depth and rigor. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of *why* the stagnation occurs or how it could be resolved.",
        "The experiments are limited and fail to explore alternative architectures, training objectives, or optimization techniques that could better address the problem.",
        "The experimental results are trivial and do not contribute new insights. Reporting that models do not improve despite standard modifications is uninformative without deeper analysis.",
        "The paper fails to contextualize its findings in the broader literature. The related work section is vague and incomplete, with placeholder citations (e.g., '[?]').",
        "The writing lacks clarity and precision, especially in the description of methods and experiments.",
        "The guidelines mentioned in the conclusion are not concrete or actionable, making them of limited utility to the community."

    "Questions": [
        "Can the authors provide a more detailed analysis of why stagnation occurs, supported by theoretical or empirical evidence?",
        "Did the authors attempt alternative approaches beyond residual connections and standard regularization techniques? If so, why were these omitted?",
        "How does this work advance understanding compared to existing literature on optimization and training dynamics?",
        "Why are there placeholder citations (e.g., '[?]') in the text? Can the authors clarify the referenced works?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not adequately address the limitations of its methodology or the scope of its findings. For example, it does not discuss whether the observed stagnation might be specific to the chosen architecture or dataset.",
        "There is no discussion of the potential societal impact of the findings, such as how they could influence resource allocation in machine learning research."
