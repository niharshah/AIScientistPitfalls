  "current_findings": "### Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Optimizer Tuning**: Switching from Adam to SGD with momentum showed improvements in training and validation metrics, indicating that optimizer choice can significantly impact model performance. The best results were achieved with a momentum value of 0.9.\n\n- **Model Architecture and Feature Engineering**:\n  - **Character-CNN and N-grams**: Incorporating character-level CNNs and expanding feature granularity with n-grams (uni-, bi-, tri-grams) improved interpretability and rule extraction. These models maintained competitive accuracy while providing explicit, interpretable rules.\n  - **L1 Regularization**: Applying L1 regularization encouraged sparsity, making rule extraction straightforward and enhancing model interpretability without significantly compromising accuracy.\n\n- **Rule Fidelity**: Across successful experiments, maintaining high rule fidelity was a consistent goal. Models that achieved high rule fidelity scores were able to provide interpretable rules that closely matched the full model's predictions.\n\n- **Interpretability and Efficiency**: Successful experiments balanced model complexity with interpretability. Models like the Soft Decision Tree and sparse logistic regression provided interpretable rules while maintaining competitive accuracy.\n\n- **Data Handling and Execution**: Proper data handling, including the use of `pathlib.Path` for path manipulations, ensured smooth execution without errors. Adhering to data-saving and execution conventions was crucial for reproducibility and analysis.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Path Handling Errors**: Using the '/' operator with strings instead of `pathlib.Path` objects led to TypeErrors. Ensuring that all path manipulations use `pathlib.Path` can prevent such errors.\n\n- **Device Mismatch**: Runtime errors occurred due to device mismatches, where tensors were on different devices (CPU vs. CUDA). Ensuring that all tensors involved in computations are on the same device is crucial to avoid such issues.\n\n- **Complexity vs. Interpretability**: While aiming for higher accuracy, some experiments risked losing interpretability. Maintaining a balance between model complexity and interpretability is essential.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Optimizer Exploration**: Continue exploring different optimizers and their configurations (e.g., varying momentum values) to find the best fit for specific models and datasets.\n\n- **Feature Engineering**: Further explore character-level features and n-gram combinations. Consider experimenting with higher-order n-grams and different embedding techniques to capture more complex patterns.\n\n- **Regularization Techniques**: Experiment with different regularization techniques (e.g., L1, L2, dropout) to enhance model sparsity and interpretability while maintaining accuracy.\n\n- **Rule Fidelity Focus**: Prioritize maintaining high rule fidelity in models to ensure that extracted rules are meaningful and closely match the model's predictions.\n\n- **Device Consistency**: Implement checks to ensure that all tensors are on the same device before computations. This can be automated in the data loading and preprocessing pipeline.\n\n- **Path Handling**: Standardize the use of `pathlib.Path` for all file and directory manipulations to avoid common path-related errors.\n\nBy leveraging these insights and recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes and avoid the pitfalls observed in previous attempts, leading to more robust and interpretable models."
