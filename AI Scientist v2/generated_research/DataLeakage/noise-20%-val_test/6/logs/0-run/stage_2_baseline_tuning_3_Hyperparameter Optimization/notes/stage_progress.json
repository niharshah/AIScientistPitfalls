  "current_findings": "## Comprehensive Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Successful experiments consistently involved systematic hyperparameter tuning. This includes varying parameters such as learning rate, weight decay, batch size, and optimizer settings. Each experiment was carefully designed to explore a range of values, leading to improved model performance.\n\n- **Early Stopping and Model Selection**: Implementing early stopping mechanisms, as seen in the num_epochs tuning, helped prevent overfitting by halting training when no improvement was observed. Restoring the best model based on validation loss was a common practice that ensured optimal test performance.\n\n- **Comprehensive Logging and Data Storage**: All successful experiments involved detailed logging of metrics, losses, and rule fidelity scores. Results were stored in structured experiment_data dictionaries, facilitating easy comparison and analysis.\n\n- **Iterative Model Building**: For each hyperparameter setting, a fresh model and optimizer were initialized. This approach ensured that each run was independent and not influenced by previous configurations, leading to more reliable results.\n\n- **Diverse Hyperparameter Exploration**: Experiments explored a wide range of hyperparameter values, such as different learning rates, weight decay values, and optimizer configurations. This diversity allowed for a thorough understanding of how each parameter affected model performance.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Lack of Experimentation with Failed Designs**: The summary does not provide specific details on failed experiments, indicating a potential gap in documenting unsuccessful trials. This lack of information can hinder learning from past mistakes and improving future designs.\n\n- **Overlooking Rule Fidelity**: While most experiments reported rule fidelity, it was not always a focus. Ensuring that models not only perform well in terms of accuracy but also adhere to rule-based constraints is crucial for interpretability and reliability.\n\n- **Inadequate Exploration of Model Architectures**: The experiments primarily focused on logistic regression models. Exploring more complex architectures or hybrid models could potentially yield better performance and insights.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Document and Analyze Failures**: Future experiments should include detailed documentation of failed attempts, including potential reasons for failure and lessons learned. This will provide valuable insights and prevent repeating the same mistakes.\n\n- **Expand Hyperparameter Exploration**: While the current experiments covered a range of hyperparameters, future work could explore additional parameters such as dropout rates, activation functions, and different model architectures to further enhance performance.\n\n- **Focus on Rule Fidelity**: Ensure that rule fidelity is consistently monitored and prioritized alongside accuracy metrics. This will improve the interpretability and trustworthiness of the models.\n\n- **Incorporate Advanced Techniques**: Consider integrating advanced techniques such as ensemble methods, transfer learning, or neural architecture search to push the boundaries of model performance.\n\n- **Enhance Data Logging and Visualization**: While logging was comprehensive, incorporating advanced visualization tools could provide deeper insights into the training process and help identify areas for improvement.\n\nBy building on these insights and recommendations, future experiments can be more robust, informative, and successful in achieving their objectives."
