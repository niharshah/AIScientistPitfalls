  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Consistent Model Architecture**: Successful experiments consistently used a small transformer encoder with learnable positional embeddings. This architecture provided a reliable baseline for further experimentation.\n\n- **Effective Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid-searching hyperparameters such as `num_epochs` showed improvements in performance metrics. For instance, increasing the number of epochs generally improved the training macro F1 score, with the best results achieved at 30 epochs.\n\n- **Early Stopping Mechanism**: Implementing early stopping with a patience of 5 epochs helped prevent overfitting and ensured efficient use of computational resources.\n\n- **Comprehensive Logging and Data Storage**: Successful experiments stored all relevant metrics, predictions, and ground truth in a structured manner, allowing for easy analysis and reproducibility.\n\n- **Device Handling**: Properly moving tensors and models to GPU when available ensured efficient computation and adherence to device handling guidelines.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Lack of Logging**: Many failed experiments did not provide meaningful logs or progress updates, making it difficult to diagnose issues or assess performance.\n\n- **Premature Termination**: Some scripts terminated prematurely without completing the training process, possibly due to hidden exceptions or inaccessible dataset paths.\n\n- **File Not Found Errors**: Several failures were due to missing dataset files or incorrect dataset paths, leading to FileNotFoundError.\n\n- **Inadequate Execution Scope**: Enclosing the entire execution logic within `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` prevented scripts from running immediately, violating framework requirements.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Logging**: Ensure that all scripts include comprehensive logging of training progress, validation results, and test performance. This will facilitate debugging and performance assessment.\n\n- **Verify Dataset Accessibility**: Double-check dataset paths and ensure that all required files are accessible before running experiments. Consider implementing flexible dataset path resolution strategies.\n\n- **Immediate Execution**: Avoid enclosing execution logic within `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`. Instead, place the training logic in the global scope to comply with framework requirements.\n\n- **Expand Hyperparameter Search**: Continue exploring hyperparameter tuning, including learning rates, batch sizes, and model dimensions, while ensuring proper logging and execution.\n\n- **Implement Robust Error Handling**: Add error handling mechanisms to capture and log exceptions, ensuring that scripts do not terminate silently.\n\n- **Optimize Model Architecture**: Consider experimenting with larger models or richer tokenization strategies to potentially improve performance further.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes and learn from the failures to achieve more robust and informative results."
