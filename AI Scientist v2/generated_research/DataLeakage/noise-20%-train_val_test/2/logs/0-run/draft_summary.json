  "Experiment_description": "These experiments explore the use of lightweight Transformer models for sequence classification tasks within the SPR_BENCH dataset, employing various strategies for embedding sequences and pooling mechanisms.",
  "Significance": "The experiments are important as they establish a baseline for sequence classification using Transformer models, highlighting the effectiveness and limitations of different approaches. This foundation is crucial for guiding future experiments that may involve larger models or more sophisticated tokenization strategies.",
  "Description": "The experiments involved treating each symbol in a sequence as a discrete token, using a Transformer encoder to capture dependencies, and employing different pooling mechanisms for classification. The models were trained and evaluated on the SPR_BENCH dataset, with performance measured using macro F1 scores and cross-entropy loss. All experiments followed standard practices for handling GPUs and utilized PyTorch for implementation.",
