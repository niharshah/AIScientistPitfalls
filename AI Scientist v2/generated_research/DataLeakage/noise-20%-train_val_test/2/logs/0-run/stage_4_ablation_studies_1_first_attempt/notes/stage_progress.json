  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Pre-training and Fine-tuning Pipeline**: Successful experiments consistently utilized a two-stage approach involving pre-training a causal transformer followed by fine-tuning for classification. This approach helped in learning richer contextual embeddings, which improved the macro-F1 scores across training, validation, and test datasets.\n\n- **Handling Padding Tokens**: Implementing a `src_key_padding_mask` to ignore `<pad>` tokens was crucial in preventing contamination of contextual representations, leading to improved performance in both pre-training and classification stages.\n\n- **Efficient Model Design**: Keeping the model compact (e.g., `d_model=128`, 3 layers) ensured that the training process was efficient and completed within a reasonable timeframe (30 minutes), without compromising on performance.\n\n- **Logging and Monitoring**: Successful experiments logged all relevant metrics (losses, macro-F1 scores) at each stage of training, which facilitated effective monitoring and early stopping based on validation performance.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Insufficient Logging**: Many failed experiments lacked detailed logging, making it difficult to determine whether the experiments executed correctly or to diagnose issues. This was a common issue across several ablation studies.\n\n- **Dataset Accessibility Issues**: Some failures were attributed to incorrect or inaccessible dataset paths, which prevented the experiments from running successfully.\n\n- **Silent Failures**: Several experiments terminated without providing meaningful output or error messages, suggesting potential unhandled exceptions or premature script termination.\n\n- **Lack of Output Verification**: In some cases, even when scripts executed, the results were not printed or logged properly, leading to incomplete or missing information about the experiment outcomes.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Logging and Debugging**: Implement comprehensive logging throughout the experimental pipeline to capture key metrics, progress updates, and potential errors. This will aid in diagnosing issues and verifying the success of experiments.\n\n- **Ensure Dataset Accessibility**: Verify that dataset paths are correctly set and accessible before running experiments. Consider implementing checks at the start of scripts to confirm dataset availability.\n\n- **Address Silent Failures**: Add error handling and debugging statements to identify and address silent failures. Ensure that all stages of the script are executed as expected and that any exceptions are logged.\n\n- **Experiment with Architectural Variants**: Continue exploring architectural variations (e.g., different activation functions, pooling strategies) while ensuring that the impact of each change is isolated and well-documented.\n\n- **Leverage Successful Patterns**: Build on the successful two-stage pre-training and fine-tuning approach, potentially exploring variations in pre-training objectives or embedding strategies to further enhance model performance.\n\nBy addressing these areas, future experiments can be more robust, informative, and successful in advancing the research objectives."
