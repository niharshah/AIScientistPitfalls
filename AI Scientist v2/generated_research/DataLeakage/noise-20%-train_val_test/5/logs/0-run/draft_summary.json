  "Experiment_description": "The experiments involve establishing a minimal end-to-end baseline using a lightweight Transformer encoder for processing SPR_BENCH dataset splits. Each node aims to refine the baseline by tracking accuracy and loss metrics across training, validation, and test datasets.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are crucial as they lay the groundwork for developing an effective model for the SPR_BENCH dataset. The insights into overfitting and misclassifications are invaluable for informing future iterations and model improvements.",
  "Description": "All nodes use a Transformer encoder with tokenized input sequences mapped to fixed vectors via masked mean-pooling, followed by classification. The models are trained over multiple epochs with cross-entropy loss, evaluating on training and validation datasets to monitor accuracy and loss.",
