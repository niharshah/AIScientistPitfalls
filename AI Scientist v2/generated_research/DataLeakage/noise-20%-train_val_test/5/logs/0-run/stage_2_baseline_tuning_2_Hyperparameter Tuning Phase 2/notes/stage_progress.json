  "current_findings": "## Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Systematic Hyperparameter Tuning**: Successful experiments consistently involved systematic hyperparameter tuning, such as varying the number of epochs, learning rates, batch sizes, dropout rates, embedding dimensions, weight decay, number of layers, and attention heads. This systematic approach allowed for a comprehensive exploration of the parameter space and identification of configurations that improved model performance.\n\n- **Reproducibility and Documentation**: Each experiment was designed to be reproducible, with results being saved in a structured format (e.g., `experiment_data.npy`). This ensured that results could be easily analyzed, plotted, and compared across different runs.\n\n- **Incremental Improvements**: While none of the experiments surpassed the 80% SOTA benchmark, incremental improvements were observed with certain configurations. For example, the highest test accuracy achieved was 80.3% with a specific number of attention heads, indicating that some configurations were closer to the benchmark than others.\n\n- **Error-Free Execution**: The successful experiments were executed without any bugs or errors, indicating robust implementation and testing of the scripts.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Inability to Surpass SOTA**: Despite various tuning efforts, none of the experiments managed to surpass the 80% SOTA benchmark. This suggests potential limitations in the current model architecture or hyperparameter space being explored.\n\n- **Limited Exploration of Architectural Changes**: The experiments primarily focused on hyperparameter tuning without significant exploration of architectural changes. This might have limited the potential for achieving breakthrough improvements in performance.\n\n- **Lack of Failed Experiment Data**: The absence of documented failed experiments makes it challenging to identify specific pitfalls or errors that could be avoided in future experiments.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Explore Architectural Changes**: In addition to hyperparameter tuning, consider exploring architectural changes such as different model architectures, layer types, or novel components that could potentially lead to significant performance improvements.\n\n- **Incorporate Advanced Techniques**: Experiment with advanced techniques such as transfer learning, ensemble methods, or data augmentation to enhance model performance.\n\n- **Analyze Failed Experiments**: Document and analyze any failed experiments to identify common pitfalls and areas for improvement. Understanding why certain configurations did not work can provide valuable insights for future experiments.\n\n- **Focus on Benchmarking**: Establish clear benchmarks and goals for each experiment. This will help in systematically evaluating the impact of different configurations and identifying the most promising approaches.\n\n- **Iterative Experimentation**: Adopt an iterative approach to experimentation, where insights from one set of experiments inform the design of subsequent experiments. This will help in progressively refining the model and achieving better results.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations and learning from both successes and potential failures, future experiments can be more targeted and effective in achieving desired performance benchmarks."
