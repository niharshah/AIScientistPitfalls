  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Reproducibility and Baseline Establishment**: The initial design of a simple, reproducible baseline using a lightweight transformer encoder was crucial. This provided a solid foundation for further experimentation and allowed for consistent comparisons across different hyperparameter tuning experiments.\n\n- **Effective Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic hyperparameter tuning, such as adjusting epochs, learning rates, batch sizes, weight decay, dropout rates, number of layers, and attention heads, led to incremental improvements in model performance. Each tuning experiment was well-structured, with clear logging and evaluation metrics, which facilitated the identification of optimal settings.\n\n- **Early Stopping Implementation**: The use of early stopping based on validation macro-F1 scores helped prevent overfitting and ensured that the best-performing model was selected for evaluation on the test set.\n\n- **Consistent Metric Tracking**: Across all successful experiments, consistent tracking of training and validation losses, as well as macro F1 scores, provided clear insights into model performance and convergence behavior.\n\n- **Data Management and Logging**: Proper organization and storage of experiment data, including metrics and model predictions, allowed for easy analysis and comparison of results without the need to rerun experiments.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Deeper Model Configurations**: Experiments with deeper transformer models (e.g., 6 layers) struggled with convergence and resulted in lower F1 scores. This suggests potential issues with vanishing gradients or inadequate model capacity for the given task.\n\n- **Overfitting with Certain Hyperparameters**: Some hyperparameter settings, such as higher weight decay values, led to overfitting, as indicated by increased validation losses and decreased F1 scores.\n\n- **Lack of Diversity in Hyperparameter Values**: While the experiments covered a range of hyperparameters, some settings (e.g., dropout rates) might benefit from a wider or more granular range of values to explore potential improvements.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Explore Advanced Architectures**: Consider experimenting with more advanced transformer architectures or incorporating additional layers, such as attention mechanisms or residual connections, to improve model capacity and performance.\n\n- **Fine-Tune Hyperparameter Ranges**: Expand the range of hyperparameter values, especially for those that showed sensitivity (e.g., learning rate, dropout rate), to capture potential performance gains that might have been missed.\n\n- **Investigate Deeper Models**: For deeper transformer configurations, investigate techniques to improve convergence, such as gradient clipping, learning rate scheduling, or layer normalization.\n\n- **Incorporate Regularization Techniques**: To address overfitting, explore additional regularization techniques, such as L2 regularization or more sophisticated dropout strategies, to enhance model generalization.\n\n- **Conduct Ablation Studies**: Perform ablation studies to understand the impact of each component of the model architecture and training process, which can provide insights into which elements are most critical for performance.\n\n- **Leverage Ensemble Methods**: Consider using ensemble methods to combine predictions from multiple models or configurations, which can potentially boost overall performance by leveraging the strengths of different models.\n\nBy building on the successes and addressing the identified pitfalls, future experiments can continue to improve model performance and robustness on the SPR_BENCH dataset."
