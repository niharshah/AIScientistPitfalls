% Paper 0 provides a mechanistic analysis of transformers in symbolic reasoning tasks, identifying interpretable mechanisms that are highly relevant to understanding how transformers can be enhanced with symbolic reasoning capabilities. Paper 1 offers a theoretical perspective on how transformers learn and generalize symbolic multi-step reasoning tasks through gradient descent, supporting the hypothesis about their reasoning capabilities. Both papers should be cited in the Related Work section to contextualize the use of transformer models in symbolic reasoning tasks and support the research hypothesis.
