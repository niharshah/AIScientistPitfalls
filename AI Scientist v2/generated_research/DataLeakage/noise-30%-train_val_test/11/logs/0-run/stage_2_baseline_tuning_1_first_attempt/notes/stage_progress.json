  "current_findings": "## Comprehensive Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Baseline Establishment**: A lightweight character-/symbol-level Transformer baseline was established, which provided a solid foundation for further experimentation. The baseline achieved a test macro F1 score of 0.6989.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: \n  - **Learning Rate**: A grid search over learning rates demonstrated that a learning rate of 0.001 yielded the best test macro F1 score. This highlights the importance of tuning learning rates for optimal model performance.\n  - **Batch Size**: Sweeping over different batch sizes (32, 64, 128) showed consistent performance, with a test macro F1 score of 0.7009, indicating that batch size can be adjusted without significant impact on performance.\n  - **Dropout**: Testing various dropout rates (0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) resulted in stable performance, with macro F1 scores close to 0.7, suggesting robustness to dropout variations.\n  - **Weight Decay**: Different weight decay values were tested, showing consistent behavior and reasonable performance, emphasizing the role of regularization in model training.\n  - **Embedding Dimension**: Exploring different embedding sizes (128, 192, 256, 384) showed that smaller dimensions (128) performed slightly better, indicating that larger embedding sizes do not necessarily improve performance.\n  - **Number of Attention Heads**: Varying the number of attention heads (4, 8, 16) resulted in consistent macro F1 scores, suggesting flexibility in this hyperparameter.\n\n- **Execution and Logging**: All successful experiments were executed without errors, and results were logged and saved properly, ensuring reproducibility and ease of analysis.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **FileNotFoundError**: A common failure was the FileNotFoundError due to incorrect dataset paths. This error occurred when the script attempted to load datasets from non-existent locations.\n\n- **Overfitting**: In some experiments, increasing the number of epochs did not lead to improved validation or test performance, indicating potential overfitting.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Dataset Management**: Ensure that dataset files are correctly placed and accessible. Verify that the DATA_DIR variable points to the correct directory. Implement a utility to handle missing files gracefully by searching for datasets or creating synthetic ones.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Exploration**: Continue to explore hyperparameters systematically. Consider expanding the search space for learning rates and embedding dimensions, as these showed significant impact on performance.\n\n- **Regularization Techniques**: Given the potential for overfitting, explore additional regularization techniques such as early stopping, L2 regularization, or more sophisticated dropout strategies.\n\n- **Model Architecture**: While the baseline architecture is solid, consider experimenting with more layers or different Transformer variants to potentially enhance performance.\n\n- **Automated Logging**: Implement automated logging and monitoring tools to track experiments in real-time, which can help in quickly identifying and addressing issues such as overfitting or data loading errors.\n\nBy following these recommendations and learning from both successful and failed experiments, future research can be more efficient and yield better-performing models."
