  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Minimal yet Complete Baseline**: Successful experiments consistently started with a minimal yet complete baseline. This involved using a simple Transformer-encoder classifier with 2 layers and 128-dimensional embeddings. The focus was on building a robust foundation before adding complexity.\n\n- **Tokenization Strategy**: A common approach was to tokenize sequences at the symbol or character level, which allowed for the creation of a simple vocabulary. This strategy ensured that every abstract symbol was treated as a token, facilitating effective embedding and processing.\n\n- **Efficient Training and Evaluation**: All successful experiments utilized efficient training processes, often completing within a 30-minute budget. The use of Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss was standard, with careful monitoring of validation loss and macro-F1 scores.\n\n- **GPU Utilization**: The experiments were designed to be GPU-aware, moving all tensors and models to GPU when available. This ensured faster computation and efficient resource utilization.\n\n- **Comprehensive Data Handling**: Key artifacts such as losses, macro-F1 scores, predictions, and ground-truth were consistently stored in an experiment_data dictionary. This facilitated easy tracking and reproducibility of results.\n\n- **Consistent Performance Metrics**: Successful experiments achieved high training macro F1 scores (above 0.98) and consistent validation and test macro F1 scores around 0.69 to 0.70, indicating a reliable baseline performance.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Lack of Complexity in Baseline**: While a minimal baseline is essential, overly simplistic models may not capture the nuances of the dataset, leading to suboptimal performance. It's important to balance simplicity with the ability to generalize.\n\n- **Inadequate Tokenization**: Failing to properly tokenize sequences can lead to poor embedding and model performance. It's crucial to ensure that the tokenization strategy aligns with the data characteristics.\n\n- **Ignoring Overfitting**: High training scores with relatively lower validation and test scores suggest potential overfitting. This indicates that the model is not generalizing well to unseen data.\n\n- **Resource Mismanagement**: Not utilizing available computational resources efficiently, such as failing to leverage GPU capabilities, can lead to longer training times and inefficient experiments.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Baseline Complexity**: Once a solid baseline is established, consider adding complexity incrementally. This could involve experimenting with deeper Transformer layers or integrating symbolic reasoning components to capture more complex patterns.\n\n- **Refine Tokenization Techniques**: Explore advanced tokenization methods, such as subword tokenization, to improve the model's ability to handle diverse symbol sequences effectively.\n\n- **Regularization Techniques**: Implement regularization strategies, such as dropout or weight decay, to mitigate overfitting and improve model generalization.\n\n- **Optimize Resource Utilization**: Ensure that all experiments are designed to fully utilize available computational resources, including GPUs, to maximize efficiency and reduce training time.\n\n- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Beyond macro F1 scores, consider additional evaluation metrics that might provide more insights into model performance, such as precision, recall, and confusion matrices.\n\nBy building on the successful patterns and addressing the common pitfalls, future experiments can achieve more robust and generalizable results."
