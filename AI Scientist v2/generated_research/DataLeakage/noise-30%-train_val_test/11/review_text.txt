    "Summary": "The paper discusses the integration of symbolic components into neural networks for text-based tasks and identifies pitfalls such as overfitting, misleading validation performance, and domain-specific challenges. The authors conduct experiments on a text classification problem to demonstrate these issues but fail to provide meaningful solutions or actionable insights.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper addresses an important problem: the challenges of integrating symbolic components into neural networks.",
        "The emphasis on the need for rigorous experimental design and deeper error analysis is valid and relevant."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper lacks originality as it does not propose a novel methodology or framework to address the identified pitfalls.",
        "The experimental setup is limited, with insufficient analysis or exploration of alternative strategies to mitigate the issues.",
        "The findings are anecdotal and lack generality, making them less impactful for the broader ML community.",
        "Key details about the experiments and methods are either unclear or missing, making it difficult to evaluate the validity of the claims.",
        "The writing is not well-organized, and the paper fails to adequately contextualize its findings within the existing literature."

    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not propose actionable solutions to the identified challenges, limiting its practical utility.",
        "The experiments are narrow in scope and do not explore the broader implications of the findings."
