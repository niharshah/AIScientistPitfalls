        "Img_description": "The figure comprises two plots. The left plot shows 'Macro F1' versus 'Epoch' with solid lines for training and dashed lines for validation across models with varying depths (layers 1, 2, 3, and 4). The right plot shows 'Cross-Entropy Loss' versus 'Epoch' with similar line styles and depth differentiation. Both plots demonstrate overfitting, as training performance improves steadily while validation performance plateaus or degrades, especially for deeper models.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is generally clear and provides useful visual insights into the performance of models by depth. Issues include verbose legend labels, lack of y-axis unit clarification, and missing highlights for key observations (e.g., saturation points). Adding overlays or markers where validation curves plateau would enhance interpretability.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption is concise and reasonably accurate but could be more descriptive. While it mentions overfitting, it does not highlight specific observations (e.g., validation F1 saturating at ~0.70, deeper layers showing more overfitting). Adding these insights would make the caption more informative.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure adequately and correctly identifies the key trends, such as training F1 approaching 1.0 and validation F1 saturating at 0.70. However, it could be improved by discussing details like the comparative performance across depths and the behavior of the cross-entropy loss curves."
    },
    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The figure consists of two subplots. The left subplot shows the 'Macro F1' score for training and validation against epochs. The training F1 score increases rapidly and saturates near 1.0, while the validation F1 score stabilizes around 0.70. The right subplot presents the 'Cross-Entropy Loss' for training and validation against epochs. The training loss decreases and converges near 0.0, while the validation loss stabilizes at a higher value, illustrating overfitting.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is clear and provides sufficient labeling with well-defined axes and legends. However, the captions on the subplots are redundant and could be removed to reduce clutter. Additionally, annotations or markers on significant points (e.g., saturation points or stabilization regions) could enhance interpretability. The use of solid and dashed lines is effective, but adding color descriptions would improve accessibility.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption accurately describes the figure, summarizing the trends in training and validation metrics. However, it could be more concise and highlight the key takeaway (overfitting) more explicitly. For instance: 'Training F1 saturates near 1.0 while validation stabilizes around 0.70, mirroring trends in loss curves that indicate overfitting.'",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text reference adequately describes the figure and aligns with its content. However, it could better emphasize the implications of overfitting and the role of symbolic features in interpretability. Adding more detailed analysis or context would strengthen the integration of the figure into the narrative."
    },
    "figure_3": {
        "Img_description": "The image consists of three subfigures: (a) a confusion matrix showing classification performance, (b) two line plots for training/validation loss and F1 scores over epochs, and (c) a bar chart comparing final metrics (Train F1, Test F1, and SGA).",
        "Img_review": "The figure provides useful insights into model performance without the [CLS] token. However, it has several shortcomings: the confusion matrix lacks explicit axis labels, subfigure (b) needs clearer legends and consistent scaling, and subfigure (c) requires better labeling and an explanation of 'SGA.' Additionally, there is no clear indication of how the figure supports the claim of ~0.70 validation F1 and overfitting.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption is concise but insufficiently descriptive. It does not provide a clear explanation of the figure's components or how they align with the stated findings (e.g., overfitting and ~0.70 validation F1). It should explicitly reference each subfigure and their contributions to the takeaway.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The figure references in the main text are missing ('[]'), offering no context or integration of the figure into the discussion. This significantly reduces the figure's impact and clarity."
    },
    "figure_4": {
        "Img_description": "The figure contains three subplots: (a) a line plot comparing training and validation loss curves with and without positional encoding, (b) a confusion matrix showing classification results without positional encoding, and (c) a line plot showing F1 curves for training and validation on a symbols-only dataset.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is informative but could be improved. Subfigure (b) lacks a color bar for the confusion matrix, making it harder to interpret the values intuitively. Subfigures (a) and (c) could use clearer legends or titles to explain the curves. Axes are labeled adequately, but additional annotations (e.g., overfitting indicators) would enhance readability. The overall layout is clean but could benefit from more consistent visual elements.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption is technically accurate but overly concise. While it captures the main takeaway (that removing positional encoding or restricting embeddings does not prevent overfitting), it does not discuss the specific trends or results shown in the subplots. Adding specific observations would make the caption more insightful.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The figure lacks main text references, which is a significant oversight. Proper references are necessary to integrate the figure into the paper's narrative, explain its context, and highlight its importance. Without this integration, the figure risks being underutilized or misunderstood."

    "figure_5": {
        "Img_description": "The figure is a bar chart titled 'SPR_BENCH: Test Macro F1 by Num Layers (Baseline).' It displays macro-F1 scores for four configurations labeled as 'ml_1,' 'ml_2,' 'ml_3,' and 'ml_4' on the x-axis. The y-axis ranges from 0.6 to 0.7, showing minor differences in scores: 0.693, 0.701, 0.698, and 0.699, respectively.",
        "Img_review": "The bar chart is clear but uses an overly zoomed-in y-axis, exaggerating small differences. No legend or explanation is provided for the configurations ('ml_1' to 'ml_4'), and the significance of these scores is unclear. The figure would benefit from a more informative y-axis scale, a legend, and additional context for the configurations.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption partially aligns with the figure but is slightly misleading. The phrase 'gains plateau around 70%' suggests an initial improvement followed by stabilization, which is not evident in the figure. A more accurate caption would focus on the consistency of macro-F1 scores across configurations rather than implying a trend.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The figure is not referenced in the main text (indicated by the placeholder '[]'). This is a critical issue, as figures must be integrated into the text to provide context and explanation. Proper figrefs should describe the figure's purpose, summarize its findings, and explain its relevance to the study."
