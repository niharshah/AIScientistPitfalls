  "Experiment_description": "This stage involves testing character-level Transformer encoder models on the SPR_BENCH dataset. Nodes explored baseline implementations with varying data types and training strategies, focusing on performance metrics such as loss and Macro-F1 scores.",
  "Significance": "The experiments are crucial for identifying overfitting and class imbalance in character-level models, providing a foundation for refining models to improve generalization and balanced performance across classes.",
  "Description": "Experiments utilized a lightweight character-level Transformer encoder model with two layers, four heads, and a hidden size of 128. Models were trained using cross-entropy loss, with metrics like loss and Macro-F1 scores tracked. The goal was to assess baseline performance and identify challenges like overfitting and class-specific biases.",

      "description": "The loss curve indicates that the training loss decreases rapidly during the first epoch and then stabilizes, with minor fluctuations.",

      "description": "The training loss decreases steadily over epochs, but the validation loss increases after an initial decrease, suggesting overfitting.",
      "analysis": "This indicates the model is memorizing training data rather than generalizing, necessitating regularization."
