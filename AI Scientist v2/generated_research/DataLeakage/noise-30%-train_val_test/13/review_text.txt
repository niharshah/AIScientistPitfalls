    "Summary": "The paper introduces the Symbolic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) benchmark to evaluate transformer models' generalization capabilities on symbolic reasoning tasks. It identifies hidden-rule overfitting in transformers, showing they fail to generalize to unseen rule combinations. A hybrid neural-symbolic approach improves interpretability but does not address the generalization bottleneck.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper tackles an important problem in symbolic reasoning and generalization.",
        "The introduction of the SPR benchmark is a useful contribution to evaluate models' extrapolation capabilities.",
        "The empirical findings highlight a consistent generalization gap in transformers and hybrid models."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper lacks methodological novelty, relying on standard transformer and hybrid neural-symbolic architectures.",
        "No significant improvements or solutions are proposed to address the identified issue of hidden-rule overfitting.",
        "Experimental scope is limited, with no exploration of alternative approaches like data augmentation, specialized rule modules, or other architectures.",
        "The hybrid model shows limited improvement over the baseline and does not sufficiently justify its inclusion.",
        "The conclusions are mostly exploratory and do not advance the state of the art in addressing symbolic reasoning challenges."
