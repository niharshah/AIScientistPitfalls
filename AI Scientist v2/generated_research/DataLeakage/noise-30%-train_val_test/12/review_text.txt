    "Summary": "The paper highlights common pitfalls and challenges in downstream model evaluation, including issues like overfitting, fragile hyperparameters, and domain mismatches. It presents anecdotal findings from experiments on transformer-based models, showing how slight changes in training conditions can lead to inconclusive or unstable results.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper addresses a relevant and under-discussed topic: the challenges of deploying deep learning models in real-world scenarios.",
        "It emphasizes the importance of robust evaluation and transparent reporting."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper lacks technical depth and novelty. It does not propose new methods, frameworks, or solutions to address the challenges it discusses.",
        "The experiments are poorly described with insufficient details on datasets, training setups, and metrics. There is no statistical rigor or reproducibility analysis.",
        "The related work section is weak, with missing citations and no meaningful connection to prior studies.",
        "The findings are anecdotal and do not provide actionable insights or generalizable conclusions.",
        "The paper fails to provide empirical evidence to support its claims rigorously, such as thorough ablation studies or comparisons."
