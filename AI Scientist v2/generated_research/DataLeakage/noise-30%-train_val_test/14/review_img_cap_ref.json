        "Img_description": "The image is a placeholder that contains the text 'figure1.png,' indicating that the actual figure is missing from the submission.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is missing, so no meaningful evaluation of its content, quality, or elements can be conducted. It is crucial that the actual figure is included in the submission for proper review.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption refers to validation performance and mentions stagnation around 0.70. However, without the figure, it is impossible to determine if the caption accurately describes the content. Ensure the figure is included so that alignment can be assessed.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references 'figure1.png,' but since the figure is absent, it is unclear whether the references adequately describe or integrate with the figure. Reevaluate this after the figure is properly included."
    },
    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The provided image is a placeholder with the text 'figure2.png' written on it. There is no graphical or scientific content to analyze.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is missing, as only a placeholder image is provided. Without the actual figure, it is impossible to evaluate its quality, clarity, or relevance to the paper. The authors should replace the placeholder with the real figure for proper review.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption cannot be assessed for accuracy or relevance because the actual figure is missing. Once the figure is provided, the caption should be re-evaluated to ensure it aligns with the data and provides a concise, accurate summary.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The references in the main text mention the figure but cannot be evaluated for adequacy or accuracy due to the absence of the actual figure. Upon provision of the figure, the references should be reviewed again to ensure they describe the figure's context, content, and purpose effectively."
    },
    "figure_3": {
        "Img_description": "The provided image is a placeholder labeled 'figure3.png' and does not contain any meaningful visual content, such as axes, data points, or graphical elements.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is missing entirely, showing only a placeholder. This is a critical issue as it prevents any analysis of the figure itself. To improve, the actual confusion matrix should be included, with clear axes, class labels, and numerical or visual data (e.g., color-coded cells) to represent the distribution of misclassifications.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption claims that the confusion matrix shows no single confusion as the primary driver of error, indicating relatively even distribution of misclassifications. However, given the absence of the actual figure, this claim cannot be verified or evaluated. The caption is concise and appropriately descriptive but requires the figure to validate its accuracy.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The references to the figure in the main text claim that misclassifications are evenly distributed across classes and that the figure supports this observation. However, since the figure is missing, these claims cannot be substantiated. The references describe the intended purpose of the figure well but lack grounding due to the figure's absence."

    "figure_4": {
        "Img_description": "The image is a placeholder labeled 'figure4.png' with no graphical content or data visualization.",
        "Img_review": "The figure does not contain any meaningful content to analyze. It is a placeholder and must be replaced with the actual ablation results for a thorough review. The absence of a proper figure is a significant issue.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption describes ablation results and concludes that gating removal does not produce notable improvements. While this is concise and to the point, the lack of an actual figure makes it impossible to assess whether the caption accurately matches the figure's content.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references provide some context about the figure, stating that it illustrates the minimal impact of removing or tuning the gating mechanism. However, the placeholder figure prevents verification of these claims. The references would benefit from more detailed descriptions of the expected visual elements and takeaways from the figure."
