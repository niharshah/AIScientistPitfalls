    "Summary": "The paper investigates the integration of symbolic tokens in neural pipelines for classification tasks. Despite initial optimism, the approach faces persistent performance plateaus at around 70% Macro-F1. The authors argue for the importance of publishing negative results to guide future research.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper highlights the importance of publishing negative or inconclusive results, which is often overlooked in the field.",
        "The experiments are conducted systematically, with hyperparameter sweeps and ablation studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper lacks technical novelty and does not advance the state of the art in any significant way.",
        "The contribution is limited to a negative result without providing meaningful insights into why the approach fails or how it can be improved.",
        "The description of the methodology is vague, especially regarding how symbolic tokens are integrated with neural components.",
        "The experimental setup and findings are insufficiently detailed, leaving readers with more questions than answers.",
        "The paper does not propose any concrete next steps or alternative approaches for overcoming the observed limitations."

    "Questions": [
        "Can the authors provide more detailed explanations of the symbolic token integration process?",
        "What theoretical or empirical insights can be drawn to explain the persistent performance plateau?",
        "Are there specific scenarios or domains where the proposed approach might work better?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not adequately address the root causes of the observed performance plateau, nor does it propose actionable improvements.",
        "The societal impact of the work is not discussed, though it is likely minimal given the inconclusive findings."
