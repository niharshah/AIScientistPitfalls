    "figure_1": {
        "Img_description": "The figure consists of two sub-plots labeled (a) and (b), but both are placeholders displaying filenames 'dropout.png' and 'transformer_curves.png' instead of actual data visualizations.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is non-informative in its current state, as it only contains placeholders instead of actual plots. It is impossible to analyze trends, axis labels, or conclusions. The placeholders should be replaced with the correct and finalized plots for a meaningful review.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption, 'Key results illustrating plateaued performance across models,' is concise but cannot be evaluated for accuracy as the figure contains no data. Once the actual figure is provided, the caption should be reassessed for alignment.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The figrefs in the main text describe detailed trends and observations (e.g., dropout sensitivity, convergence at 70% macro-F1, minor ablation effects). However, since the figure contains no data, it is impossible to assess whether the text references accurately describe the figure. The figure must first be updated with actual plots before this can be evaluated."
    },
    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The image only contains the text 'ablation_embedding.png' and does not provide any graphical or tabular data. It appears to be a placeholder rather than a meaningful figure.",
        "Img_review": "The figure lacks any visual content, such as graphs, tables, or data representations, necessary for analysis. It does not fulfill the purpose of demonstrating the impact of removing learned embeddings. The figure should be replaced with a proper visualization or removed if no relevant content exists.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption, 'Ablation removing learned embeddings,' suggests that the figure should depict the effects of an ablation study. However, the image does not contain any relevant data or visualization. The caption is misaligned with the figure, and a concise summary of the ablation results should be included when the figure is updated.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references are missing, as indicated by the empty brackets ([]). This indicates a failure to integrate and explain the figure in the manuscript. The figure should be properly referenced and discussed in the text to provide context and highlight its significance."
    },
    "figure_3": {
        "Img_description": "The figure consists of two subfigures labeled 'ablation_embedding.png' and 'ablation_ffn.png,' both of which are placeholders. No actual data or visualization is provided.",
        "Img_review": "The figure contains only placeholders without any data visualization, making it impossible to interpret or analyze scientifically. Elements like axis labels, legends, and annotations are missing. The figure does not provide meaningful insight in its current form.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption, 'Ablation removing feedforward network,' is incongruent with the content of the figure. The subfigure labels reference 'embedding' and 'feedforward network,' creating confusion. The caption is too brief and lacks a clear takeaway or context.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The figure lacks any references in the main text. Without these, the figure's purpose, context, and relevance are unclear. Main text references should describe the figure and its implications for the study."
