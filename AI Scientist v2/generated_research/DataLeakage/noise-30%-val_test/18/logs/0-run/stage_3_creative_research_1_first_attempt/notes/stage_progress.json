  "current_findings": "### Comprehensive Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Successful experiments often involved careful hyperparameter tuning, such as the weight decay sweep in the initial experiment. The best test F1 score of 0.6958 was achieved with a weight decay of 5e-05, highlighting the importance of fine-tuning hyperparameters to optimize model performance.\n\n- **Transformer Architecture**: Transitioning from LSTM to a Transformer encoder consistently showed improvements in capturing long-range dependencies and symbolic relations. This was evident in multiple experiments where the Transformer architecture outperformed the LSTM baseline, achieving higher Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and F1 scores.\n\n- **Hybrid Models**: Incorporating explicit symbolic statistics alongside Transformer encoders proved beneficial. By fusing learned sequential context with handcrafted features (e.g., sequence length, parity), models were able to better capture rule factors, leading to improved performance metrics.\n\n- **Efficient Training and Logging**: Successful experiments maintained efficient training processes, often completing within 30 minutes, and adhered to robust logging practices. This ensured that all metrics, losses, predictions, and ground-truth labels were consistently saved for analysis.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Incorrect Initialization**: A notable failure occurred due to a TypeError in the initialization of the SPRTransformer class. This was caused by incorrect handling of the vocabulary size, where an integer was mistakenly treated as a subscriptable object. Ensuring correct initialization and parameter handling is crucial to avoid such errors.\n\n- **Underperforming Models**: Some experiments, despite being executed successfully, did not achieve competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline. This indicates a need for further optimization and model adjustments to reach desired performance levels.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Refine Hyperparameter Tuning**: Continue to explore hyperparameter spaces, particularly focusing on weight decay, learning rates, and dropout rates. Automated hyperparameter optimization techniques could be employed to systematically identify optimal settings.\n\n- **Enhance Model Architectures**: Further investigate hybrid models that combine Transformer encoders with explicit symbolic features. Experiment with different ways of integrating these features, such as varying the dimensionality of embeddings or exploring alternative fusion techniques.\n\n- **Address Initialization Errors**: Implement thorough checks for model initialization parameters to prevent errors like the TypeError encountered. Consider using unit tests or validation scripts to verify that all components are correctly set up before full-scale training.\n\n- **Optimize Training Strategies**: Explore advanced training strategies such as cosine-annealing learning-rate schedules and early stopping to stabilize training and potentially improve convergence.\n\n- **Benchmark Against SOTA**: Regularly benchmark new models against the SOTA to ensure that they are competitive. If performance lags, conduct a detailed analysis to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, future experiments can build on past successes while avoiding common pitfalls, ultimately leading to more robust and high-performing models."
