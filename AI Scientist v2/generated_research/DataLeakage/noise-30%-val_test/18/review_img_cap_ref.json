        "Img_review": "The image does not provide any meaningful content to analyze. If this is a placeholder, the authors should replace it with the actual figure to facilitate proper evaluation.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption cannot be evaluated against the provided image, as the image is a placeholder and does not contain relevant data. If the actual figure aligns with the caption's description of test MCC comparisons, it should be verified against the claims once properly included.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The figure references in the main text describe comparisons of test MCC values across different ablations and a baseline. However, the absence of a proper figure makes it impossible to assess whether the references adequately describe or integrate the figure. The authors should ensure the actual figure is included for proper evaluation."

        "Img_description": "The provided image is a placeholder labeled 'Aggregate_Ablations_Comparison.png' and does not contain any visible data, graphs, or diagrams for analysis.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is unavailable for direct analysis. Without the actual content, it is impossible to evaluate its design, clarity, or alignment with the intended purpose. If this is a placeholder, the actual figure must be included in the paper for proper review. Suggestions for improvement include ensuring the inclusion of clear axes labels, legends, and meaningful visual elements that align with the described metrics (MCC and Macro-F1) and the ablation trends.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption provides a concise description of what the figure is intended to show, mentioning 'Additional ablation comparisons with MCC and Macro-F1 metrics' and a brief observation about performance trends. However, without the figure, its accuracy cannot be verified. The caption could be improved by summarizing the key takeaway more explicitly (e.g., specific observations about baseline performance or noteworthy trends).",
        "Figrefs_review": "The figrefs in the main text describe the figure's purpose and content, specifically referencing varied Transformer components (embedding layers, positional encodings, etc.) and supplementary results. This aligns well with the caption. However, without the figure, it is unclear whether these references adequately integrate or explain the visual content. The authors should ensure the text provides sufficient context for interpreting the figure."
