  "Experiment_description": "The experiments involve establishing a compact character-level neural network baseline for sequence classification. Each node employs a similar architecture with an Embedding layer, Bi-LSTM, mean pooling, and Linear layers, trained using BCEWithLogitsLoss and Adam optimizer on the SPR_BENCH dataset.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are crucial for establishing a foundational model architecture that can be further optimized for better performance. Understanding the baseline's strengths and weaknesses will guide future iterations and improvements in sequence classification tasks.",
  "Description": "The baseline models process tokenized sequences through a neural network to classify them. The architecture comprises an Embedding layer, Bi-LSTM, mean pooling, and Linear layers. Models are trained using BCEWithLogitsLoss and the Adam optimizer. Performance is evaluated using loss metrics and the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), with results visualized using various plots.",
