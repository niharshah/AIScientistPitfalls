  "Experiment_description": "The experiments involve developing and evaluating a character-level neural network model for the SPR_BENCH dataset. The architecture includes an embedding layer, a bidirectional GRU, and a linear classifier, trained using the Adam optimizer and BCE-with-logits loss. Performance is monitored using Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) across training, validation, and test datasets.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are foundational for understanding the model's capacity to process sequential data using a lightweight architecture. The findings provide insights into the strengths and limitations of the current model, particularly in terms of generalization and overfitting, guiding future improvements in algorithm design.",
  "Description": "Each node constructs a character-level vocabulary, encodes sequences into integer arrays, and trains the model on the SPR_BENCH dataset. The training involves monitoring BCE loss and MCC, with results logged for performance evaluation. The models are executed on GPUs for efficiency, and the experiments aim to establish a baseline for future iterations.",
