% The paper 'Neural-Symbolic Integration: A Compositional Perspective' discusses a modular approach to integrating neural networks and symbolic reasoning frameworks. This is highly relevant to the proposed methodology for combining neural and symbolic systems to enable zero-shot generalization in Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning. It can be cited in the related work section to provide foundational background and support for the approach.

% The paper 'Siamese recurrent networks learn first-order logic reasoning and exhibit zero-shot compositional generalization' demonstrates how recurrent neural networks can effectively learn logical reasoning and generalize to unseen tasks using compositional generalization. This is highly relevant to the proposed methodology of combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning frameworks for zero-shot learning and can be cited in the related work section to strengthen the argument for the feasibility of such an approach in Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning.

% This paper discusses the introduction of weighted evaluation metrics for neuro-symbolic frameworks, which is conceptually aligned with the use of metrics like Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) and Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) in evaluating neuro-symbolic reasoning. It provides support for the methodology section where these metrics are explained and used for evaluating the model's performance.

% The paper 'MAC: A Benchmark for Multiple Attributes Compositional Zero-Shot Learning' introduces the MAC dataset, which focuses on compositional zero-shot learning with multi-attribute associations. This is relevant as it provides a broader context for benchmarks in compositional reasoning tasks, which parallels the use of SPR_BENCH in evaluating neuro-symbolic zero-shot learning. It should be cited in the methodology section to support the choice of SPR_BENCH and provide comparative insights into compositional learning benchmarks.

% The paper 'Modeling Patterns for Neural-Symbolic Reasoning Using Energy-based Models' discusses the neural-symbolic interface and provides empirical analysis on reasoning with probability, logic, and arithmetic constraints. It highlights challenges such as model complexity and computational cost, which are directly relevant to the risk factors and limitations mentioned in the proposal. This citation should be included in the discussion of challenges in integrating neural and symbolic systems, particularly in the 'Risk Factors and Limitations' section.

% The paper 'Empirical Evaluation of Gated Recurrent Neural Networks on Sequence Modeling' provides a detailed empirical analysis of GRUs compared to other recurrent units, demonstrating their effectiveness in sequence modeling tasks such as polyphonic music modeling and speech signal modeling. This citation supports the methodology section by justifying the choice of GRUs in the proposed neural-symbolic model for Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning.
