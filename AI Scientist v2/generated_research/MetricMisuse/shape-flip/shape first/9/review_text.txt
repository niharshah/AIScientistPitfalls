    "Summary": "The paper proposes a neuro-symbolic approach to address zero-shot rule adaptation in Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR). It combines a GRU-based neural network with symbolic features derived from shape-based rules to improve generalization. The proposed method achieves high shape-weighted accuracy on unseen tasks and explores the impact of batch size on training dynamics.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a relevant problem in zero-shot reasoning and generalization.",
        "Proposes a hybrid neuro-symbolic model, which is conceptually interesting.",
        "Investigates the impact of batch size on training, highlighting an underexplored issue.",
        "Achieves strong results on the SPR benchmark, with perfect shape-weighted accuracy in some cases."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The technical novelty is limited. Combining neural networks with symbolic features is not a new idea, and the paper lacks substantial innovation beyond existing work.",
        "The experimental setup is narrow and limited to a single benchmark (SPR), which raises concerns about the generality of the approach.",
        "The analysis of results is shallow, with insufficient discussion on why the proposed method works and its broader implications.",
        "The paper does not adequately clarify the limitations of the approach or its computational overhead, which is briefly mentioned but not quantified.",
        "Clarity is poor in several sections, including the description of the symbolic module and the fusion mechanism. The methodology lacks sufficient detail for reproducibility.",
        "The ablation studies are superficial and do not provide meaningful insights into the contributions of different components."

    "Questions": [
        "How does the proposed neuro-symbolic approach compare to other state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot reasoning beyond the SPR benchmark?",
        "Can the authors provide more details on the symbolic feature extraction process and its computational cost?",
        "What are the specific limitations of the proposed approach in terms of scalability and generalization to other domains?",
        "Why does smaller batch size lead to better performance, and is this observation consistent across different tasks and benchmarks?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not provide a thorough analysis of the trade-offs introduced by the neuro-symbolic framework, such as computational overhead and scalability.",
        "The generalizability of the approach to real-world tasks or other benchmarks is unclear."
