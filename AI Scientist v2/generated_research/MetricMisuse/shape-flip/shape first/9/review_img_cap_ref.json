    "figure_1": {
        "Img_description": "The figure contains three subplots. Subplot (a) displays the training and validation loss curves over epochs for batch sizes 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256. Smaller batch sizes converge faster with lower final losses. Subplot (b) shows the validation HWA over epochs, with smaller batch sizes achieving higher HWA values. Subplot (c) is a bar chart comparing test HWA scores for each batch size, where smaller batch sizes outperform larger ones.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is informative and clearly presents the impact of batch size on training and evaluation metrics. However, improvements could include defining 'HWA' explicitly, adding legends to subplots (b) and (c), and ensuring consistent axis labeling. These changes would enhance clarity and comprehension.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption aligns with the figure and provides a concise summary of the trends. It could be improved by briefly explaining what 'HWA' represents, as this term is central to the analysis but not defined in the figure or caption.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure appropriately and discusses the key trends. However, it could better integrate the specific metrics shown in subplots (b) and (c), particularly explaining the role of HWA in evaluating model performance."
    },
    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The figure comprises three subplots: (a) Loss, showing quickly decreasing training and validation losses over epochs, with both stabilizing at low values; (b) Validation Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), showing SWA rapidly increasing and reaching 1.0, indicating perfect validation accuracy; and (c) Confusion Matrix, displaying a heatmap with perfect classification (no off-diagonal errors) for two classes with 55 and 245 samples respectively.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is well-structured, with clear axes and labels. However, the legend in subplot (a) overlaps with the graph and could be repositioned for better clarity. The titles and axes are clear but could include additional context or units for metrics like 'Cost Entropy Loss' and 'SWA.' A note clarifying the class distribution in the confusion matrix would enhance interpretability.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption accurately describes the figure's key findings: rapid convergence of training loss, perfect validation accuracy, and flawless classification in the confusion matrix. It is concise but could define SWA for readers unfamiliar with the metric and explicitly connect the confusion matrix to the claim of zero errors.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure effectively, aligning its claims about zero-shot classification and perfect performance with the data shown. However, it could elaborate on the role of the confusion matrix in verifying the claim of perfect classification and discuss the trade-off in overhead more explicitly in the context of the figure."
    },
    "figure_3": {
        "Img_description": "The figure contains five subplots labeled (a) Binary Symbolic, (b) Late Fusion, (c) Neural Only, (d) No Projection, and (e) Unidirectional GRU. Each subplot includes multiple visual elements such as line plots, bar charts, and confusion matrices, which convey results of an ablation study. Examples of axis labels include 'Epochs' and metrics like accuracy or loss.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is informative but suffers from clarity issues. Axes and legends are not clearly labeled, making interpretation difficult. The dense layout and lack of numerical labels on confusion matrices further hinder readability. Splitting the figure into separate, simpler subplots might improve clarity. Enlarging and clearly labeling all elements would be beneficial.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption is concise but lacks detail and specificity. While it mentions performance variations and trends in zero-shot shape accuracy, it does not explain how these are reflected in the subplots or provide any key takeaways. A revised caption should summarize the trends observed and relate them to the architectural tweaks.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references are missing ([]). Proper figrefs are necessary to integrate the figure into the paper's narrative and provide context for its inclusion. Without them, the reader cannot fully understand the figure's purpose or significance."
