  "Experiment_description": "The experiments involved establishing a robust baseline for sequence prediction tasks using a bi-directional GRU-based neural network. The model was tested on the SPR_BENCH dataset, achieving perfect classification performance across all nodes.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are crucial as they confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the GRU-based baseline for sequence prediction tasks. The findings lay a solid foundation for future research, particularly in integrating neural-symbolic approaches, and demonstrate the model's potential for generalization.",
  "Description": "The experiments utilized a bi-directional GRU encoder with an embedding layer, followed by max-pooling and a linear head for rule label prediction. Data was processed using whitespace tokenization, with an UNK token for unseen words. The Adam optimizer was used for optimization, aiming to minimize cross-entropy loss. Performance was tracked using metrics such as training and validation loss, harmonic-weighted accuracy, and confusion matrices, ensuring robust evaluation.",
