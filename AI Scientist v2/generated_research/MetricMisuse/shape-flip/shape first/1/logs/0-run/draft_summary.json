  "Experiment_description": "Experiments involved testing a simple bag-of-tokens model and GRU-based models for classifying SPR sequences. The bag-of-tokens model was a single-layer neural classifier, while the GRU models used sequential token embeddings and mean-pooling for classification.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are important as they establish baseline performance levels for different model complexities in the context of SPR sequence classification. Insights from these experiments could guide future efforts to optimize model architecture for zero-shot generalization and improve handling of class imbalance.",
  "Description": "The bag-of-tokens approach involved creating a multiset representation of SPR sequences and training a neural classifier. The GRU models incorporated token embeddings, mean-pooling, and softmax layers to leverage sequential dependencies. Metrics such as accuracy, loss, and zero-shot rule transfer accuracy were used to assess performance.",
