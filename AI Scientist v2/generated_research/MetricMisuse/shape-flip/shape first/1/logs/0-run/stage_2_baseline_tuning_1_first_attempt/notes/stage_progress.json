  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **High Training and Validation Accuracy**: Across various experiments, the models consistently achieved near-perfect training and validation accuracies, indicating that the models were effectively learning from the training data. This was observed in experiments involving hyperparameter tuning for epochs, learning rates, dropout rates, and weight decay.\n\n- **Effective Hyperparameter Tuning**: The experiments demonstrated successful hyperparameter tuning, particularly for learning rates and dropout rates. For example, the learning rate of 0.002 was identified as optimal, achieving a validation accuracy of 99.98%. Similarly, a dropout rate of 0.2 yielded the highest validation accuracy.\n\n- **Consistent Model Training**: The models were able to train without errors or bugs, and the results were consistently logged and stored for analysis. This indicates a robust experimental setup and execution.\n\n- **Improved Evaluation Metrics**: The introduction of additional evaluation metrics, such as Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), and Harmonic-Mean Accuracy (HMA), provided a more comprehensive assessment of model performance.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Zero-Shot Rule Transfer Accuracy (ZSRTA) Issues**: A recurring issue across experiments was the inability to compute ZSRTA, often resulting in 'nan' values. This was due to the absence of unseen rules in the test set or issues in identifying zero-shot examples during evaluation.\n\n- **Dataset and Evaluation Logic Flaws**: Some experiments encountered errors due to dataset handling, such as KeyErrors when accessing non-existent keys in the dataset. This was particularly evident when the evaluation logic did not align with the dataset structure.\n\n- **Lack of Generalization to Unseen Data**: While the models performed well on seen data, they struggled with generalization to unseen data, as indicated by low or non-existent ZSRTA scores. This highlights a limitation in the model's ability to perform zero-shot reasoning.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Zero-Shot Reasoning Capabilities**: Future experiments should focus on improving the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. This could involve architectural changes, such as incorporating mechanisms specifically designed for zero-shot learning, or additional training strategies that encourage generalization.\n\n- **Ensure Presence of Unseen Rules in Test Set**: To accurately evaluate zero-shot capabilities, ensure that the test set contains examples with unseen rules. This requires careful dataset preparation and validation of the evaluation logic to correctly identify and handle zero-shot scenarios.\n\n- **Refine Evaluation Logic**: Address dataset and evaluation logic issues by ensuring that the evaluation functions are compatible with the dataset structure. This includes handling different keys in the dataset and adapting logic to work with available data.\n\n- **Leverage Additional Metrics for Comprehensive Evaluation**: Continue using a variety of evaluation metrics, such as SWA, CWA, and HMA, to gain a more nuanced understanding of model performance across different aspects.\n\n- **Iterate on Successful Hyperparameters**: Build on the successful hyperparameter tuning results by further exploring and refining these settings in conjunction with other architectural changes or training strategies.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, future experiments can build on past successes while mitigating common pitfalls, ultimately advancing the research objectives more effectively."
