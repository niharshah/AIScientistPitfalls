  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Successful experiments often involved systematic hyperparameter tuning, such as iterating over different hidden-state sizes. This approach allowed for the identification of optimal configurations that maximized performance metrics like train and validation accuracy.\n\n- **Neural-Symbolic Integration**: Effective integration of neural and symbolic components was a common factor in successful experiments. For instance, combining a Transformer encoder with symbolic features (e.g., number of distinct shapes and colors) helped guide the model toward rule abstractions and improved zero-shot generalization.\n\n- **Structured Data Handling**: Successful experiments consistently recorded all relevant metrics, predictions, and ground-truth labels in structured formats (e.g., numpy dictionaries). This facilitated thorough analysis and comparison of results.\n\n- **High Accuracy and Low Loss**: Achieving near-perfect train and validation accuracy, along with minimal validation loss, was a hallmark of successful experiments. This indicates that the models were well-tuned and effectively learned the training data.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Dataset Handling Issues**: Several failed experiments were due to dataset handling errors, such as missing dataset directories or files (e.g., 'SPR_BENCH' folder not found), leading to assertion or file not found errors.\n\n- **Zero-Shot Evaluation Bugs**: A recurring issue was the incorrect handling of zero-shot evaluation metrics like Unseen Rule Accuracy (URA) and Zero-Shot Reasoning Test Accuracy (ZSRTA), often resulting in 'nan' values. This was typically due to the absence of unseen rules in the test dataset or incorrect logic for identifying unseen labels.\n\n- **Overfitting**: Some experiments showed perfect validation accuracy but poor test performance, indicating overfitting. This suggests that the models were not generalizing well to unseen data.\n\n- **Key Errors in Evaluation**: Errors such as KeyError occurred due to incorrect dataset initialization, particularly when dataset items were missing expected keys during evaluation.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Ensure Dataset Integrity**: Verify that all required dataset files and directories are present before running experiments. Consider automating checks for dataset integrity to prevent assertion and file not found errors.\n\n- **Enhance Zero-Shot Evaluation**: Ensure that test datasets contain sequences governed by entirely new rules not present in the training set. This will allow for meaningful zero-shot evaluation. Additionally, refine the logic for identifying unseen labels to avoid 'nan' metrics.\n\n- **Implement Regularization**: To prevent overfitting, incorporate regularization techniques such as dropout or weight decay. Consider using early stopping based on validation performance to halt training before overfitting occurs.\n\n- **Refine Neural-Symbolic Integration**: Continue exploring and refining the integration of neural and symbolic components. Ensure that symbolic features are effectively utilized to guide the model in zero-shot scenarios.\n\n- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and debugging practices to quickly identify and resolve issues related to dataset handling, evaluation logic, and model training.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, future experiments can build on past successes while avoiding common pitfalls, ultimately leading to more robust and generalizable models."
