    "figure_1": {
        "Img_description": "The figure contains three subplots. The left subplot shows accuracy curves for training and validation sets over five epochs, with curves for hidden dimensions 64, 128, 256, and 512. The center subplot presents loss curves for training and validation sets over the same epochs and hidden dimensions. The right subplot is a bar chart showing final validation accuracy for each hidden dimension, with almost identical values across all dimensions.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is clear and well-labeled, with appropriate legends and axis labels. However, the y-axis in the bar chart could be better scaled to highlight subtle variations in final validation accuracy, if any. The font size of the text in the figure might be too small for some readers.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption describes the figure accurately and concisely. However, the phrase 'demonstrating consistent performance regardless of model capacity' might be slightly misleading without mentioning the very small variation in accuracy across dimensions. Adding more precision to this statement would clarify the consistency claim.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references to the figure are clear and provide sufficient context. They effectively explain the observed trends and implications. However, the second reference could have explicitly mentioned the right subplot to make the connection more direct."
    },
    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The figure contains two subplots showing accuracy and loss curves for training and validation of a unidirectional GRU model with varying hidden dimensions (64, 128, 256, 512). The x-axis represents epochs (1.0 to 5.0), while the y-axis represents accuracy (left) and loss (right). Training curves are solid lines, and validation curves are dashed lines. Both accuracy and loss stabilize over epochs, with larger hidden dimensions performing slightly better.",
        "Img_review": "The figure effectively visualizes the trends in accuracy and loss for different hidden dimensions. However, it lacks a legend, which makes it harder to differentiate between training and validation lines. The axis labels are mostly clear but could specify units or context (e.g., Accuracy (%), Loss). The title is descriptive but could briefly mention the task or dataset being evaluated.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption aligns with the figure's content and accurately summarizes the takeaway that bidirectionality is not critical for zero-shot reasoning. However, it does not describe the specific trends observed in the curves (e.g., consistent performance across hidden dimensions, plateauing trends). Adding these details would make the caption more informative.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure in a high-level manner, stating its purpose and conclusion. However, it does not adequately describe the trends or findings visible in the plots. Adding more details about the plateauing behavior, differences between training and validation, and the relative performance of different hidden dimensions would strengthen the connection between the text and figure."
    },
    "figure_3": {
        "Img_description": "The figure contains two subplots showing the results of an ablation study where the embedding layer was frozen during training. The top subplot shows accuracy curves (y-axis: Accuracy, x-axis: Epochs) for training and validation data, with different hidden dimensions (128, 256, 512, and 64). The bottom subplot shows loss curves (y-axis: Loss, x-axis: Epochs) for the same configurations. The legend distinguishes the curves by hidden dimension and training/validation split. The subplots reveal a slight decrease in training and validation accuracy and minimal differences in loss across configurations when embeddings are frozen.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is well-structured, with clear labels, legends, and distinct curves for different configurations. However, the legend could be made more concise by grouping 'Train' and 'Val' under each hidden dimension. The figure could also incorporate annotations to quantify changes in accuracy and explicitly highlight the impact on zero-shot generalization. Including a metric or note on zero-shot generalization would improve interpretability.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption accurately describes the trends seen in the figure but could be more concise. It could explicitly address why zero-shot generalization metrics are not included in the figure or clarify how they relate to the shown data. Additionally, combining statements about performance decrease and zero-shot generalization could reduce redundancy.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure appropriately, providing context about the ablation study and its conclusions. However, it could be more specific in linking particular trends (e.g., the lack of improvement across hidden dimensions) to the stated conclusions. Adding more detail about the observations would strengthen the connection between the text and the figure."
    },
    "figure_4": {
        "Img_description": "The figure contains three subplots: (1) Accuracy curves showing training and validation accuracy over epochs for different hidden dimensions, with accuracy stabilizing after initial growth; (2) Loss curves displaying a monotonically decreasing loss over epochs, stabilizing at lower values for various hidden dimensions; (3) A zero-shot rule transfer accuracy plot against hidden dimensions, showing consistently poor performance with minimal variability.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is well-structured and provides valuable insights into the model's performance under the ablation condition. However, the third subplot lacks variability or trends, which limits its interpretability. The legends could be improved for better readability, and annotations could help highlight the main findings.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption accurately describes the figure and conveys the key observations, including the slight decrease in performance and poor zero-shot generalization. However, it could be shortened to make it more concise while retaining critical details.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure adequately, describing its purpose and summarizing its findings. However, it could delve deeper into the trends observed in the accuracy and loss curves and explicitly mention the flat trend in zero-shot performance for better context."
    },
    "figure_5": {
        "Img_description": "The figure contains three subplots. The first subplot presents training and validation curves over time or epochs for various datasets or configurations. The second subplot shows test accuracy against hidden dimensions, comparing different configurations or datasets. The third subplot also evaluates test accuracy but focuses on a subset of conditions, plotted against hidden dimensions.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is clear overall, with well-labeled axes and legends, but the axis labels and title alignment could be improved for consistency. The use of statistical annotations or confidence intervals could strengthen the visual presentation and conclusions. Consistent color schemes across subplots, where applicable, would also enhance clarity.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption is accurate but somewhat broad. While it states the primary conclusion, it does not detail specific observations from the subplots. Expanding the caption to summarize key trends in each subplot would make it more informative.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure adequately but lacks detailed integration of specific trends or data points. Adding descriptions of how each subplot contributes to the overall conclusion would improve the connection between the text and the figure."
