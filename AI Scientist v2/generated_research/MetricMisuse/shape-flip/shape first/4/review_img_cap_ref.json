        "Img_description": "The figure consists of two placeholder subplots labeled (a) and (b). The left subplot, (a), is labeled 'placeholder_baseline_test_metrics.png' and described as 'Baseline test metrics across training epochs'. The right subplot, (b), is labeled 'placeholder_spr_bench_final_curves.png' and described as 'Neural-symbolic training curves under rule-based tasks'. Neither contains any graphical data or visualizations.",
        "Img_review": "The figure currently lacks any meaningful content as it consists solely of placeholders. No data, axes, legends, or trends are presented, making it impossible to derive insights or validate claims from the caption or text. The figure must be replaced with actual visualizations that include labeled axes, legends, and data relevant to the described metrics.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption, 'Examples of core performance metrics under different training schemes. Elevated standard accuracy can mask poor extrapolation,' is misleading as it references content that is not present in the figure. Once the figure is updated, the caption should be revised to accurately summarize the data and highlight the key takeaway.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references describe Figure 1 as illustrating standard classification accuracy (left) and shape-weighted accuracy (right). They also discuss the implications of these metrics. However, the placeholders in the figure do not align with this description. The references need to be updated to match the revised figure, ensuring that the described metrics and trends are clearly visualized."
