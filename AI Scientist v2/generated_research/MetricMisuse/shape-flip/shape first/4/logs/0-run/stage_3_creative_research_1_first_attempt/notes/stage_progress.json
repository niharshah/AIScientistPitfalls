  "current_findings": "### Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Neural-Symbolic Integration**: Many successful experiments incorporated a hybrid approach that combined neural networks with symbolic reasoning. This integration allowed models to handle discrete rule signals and improve zero-shot generalization, especially for unseen shape-color combinations.\n\n- **Symbolic Features**: The use of explicit symbolic features, such as shape and color histograms, variety counts, and sequence length, consistently improved performance. These features provided rule-level cues that enhanced the model's ability to generalize.\n\n- **Transformer-Based Architectures**: Lightweight Transformer encoders were commonly used to extract contextual token representations. These architectures, when combined with symbolic features, showed strong performance in both training and test metrics.\n\n- **Gating Mechanisms**: Implementing learnable gating networks allowed models to dynamically balance contributions from neural and symbolic branches. This approach was particularly effective in enhancing zero-shot reasoning capabilities.\n\n- **Efficient Training and Evaluation**: Successful experiments were characterized by efficient training processes, often completing in a few epochs, and thorough logging of metrics and artefacts for later analysis.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Dataset Availability**: A critical failure point was the absence of required datasets, such as the 'SPR_BENCH' folder. This led to execution failures due to missing data files.\n\n- **Environment Setup**: Ensuring the correct setup of environment variables and paths is crucial. Misconfigurations can lead to errors that halt the experimental process.\n\n- **Over-Reliance on Single Metrics**: While Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) was a common evaluation metric, relying solely on it without considering other metrics could lead to an incomplete assessment of model performance.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Dataset Management**: Ensure that all necessary datasets are available and correctly referenced in the script. Consider implementing checks at the start of the script to verify dataset availability and path correctness.\n\n- **Expand Symbolic Features**: Continue to explore and expand the range of symbolic features used in models. Features that capture more complex rule-level information could further improve generalization.\n\n- **Optimize Gating Mechanisms**: Further refine gating mechanisms to better balance neural and symbolic contributions. Experiment with different gating strategies to find the optimal configuration for various tasks.\n\n- **Diversify Evaluation Metrics**: While SWA is important, incorporate additional metrics to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of model performance. This could include metrics that capture different aspects of model behavior.\n\n- **Robust Environment Configuration**: Develop a robust setup script that configures environment variables and paths automatically. This will reduce the likelihood of errors related to environment setup.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, future experiments can build on the successes observed and avoid common pitfalls, leading to more robust and generalizable models."
