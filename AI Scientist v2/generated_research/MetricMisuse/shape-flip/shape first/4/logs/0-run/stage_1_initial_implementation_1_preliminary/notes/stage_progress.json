  "current_findings": "### Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Minimal Neural-Symbolic Baseline**: Successful experiments utilized a simple neural-symbolic baseline, where discrete symbols representing shape-color tokens were embedded and processed through a minimal neural model. This approach was effective in achieving reasonable accuracy on training and validation datasets.\n\n- **Rule Generalization Score (RGS)**: Although the RGS remained at 0.0 across successful experiments, the design effectively set up a framework for assessing zero-shot reasoning by focusing on tokens unseen during training.\n\n- **Reproducibility and Simplicity**: Successful experiments emphasized clean and reproducible setups, with all metrics and data stored systematically. This ensured that the experiments could serve as a reliable foundation for more complex models.\n\n- **Efficient Use of Resources**: The experiments were designed to run efficiently on available hardware, leveraging GPU resources when available and maintaining a quick runtime.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Lack of Learning in Simple Models**: In failed experiments, models showed a lack of learning, with stagnant validation accuracy and RGS. This was attributed to overly simplistic datasets, insufficient model capacity, or inappropriate hyperparameters.\n\n- **Module and File Errors**: Failures often stemmed from missing modules or dataset files, such as the 'No module named SPR' error and FileNotFoundError for dataset files. These issues highlight the importance of ensuring all necessary files and modules are correctly located and accessible.\n\n- **Over-Simplification**: Some designs were too simplistic, failing to capture meaningful patterns from the data, which led to poor performance and stagnant metrics.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Model Complexity**: To address the lack of learning in simple models, consider increasing model complexity by incorporating deeper architectures or additional layers that can capture more intricate patterns in the data.\n\n- **Dataset Complexity**: Experiment with more complex synthetic datasets that better mimic real-world scenarios to provide richer training data and improve the model's ability to generalize.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Conduct systematic hyperparameter tuning, including learning rate and batch size adjustments, to optimize model performance.\n\n- **Ensure File and Module Availability**: Before running experiments, verify the presence and correct placement of all necessary files and modules. Consider using absolute paths or updating environment variables to prevent module and file errors.\n\n- **Focus on RGS Improvement**: Since the RGS remained at 0.0, future experiments should explore methods to improve zero-shot reasoning capabilities, such as incorporating more sophisticated symbolic reasoning components or exploring transfer learning techniques.\n\n- **Maintain Reproducibility**: Continue to emphasize reproducibility by systematically storing all metrics, losses, and predictions, and ensuring that experiments can be easily replicated and extended.\n\nBy addressing these areas, future experiments can build on the successes while avoiding common pitfalls, leading to more robust and effective neural-symbolic models."
