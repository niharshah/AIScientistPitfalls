    "Summary": "The paper proposes a hybrid neural-symbolic model for zero-shot Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR). It combines a neural feature extractor with symbolic rule-based inference to generalize to novel constraints without further training. The approach is evaluated on the SPR BENCH dataset, showing modest improvements in accuracy and shape-weighted accuracy over a purely neural baseline. The authors highlight challenges involving generalization to unseen rules and discuss potential pitfalls of their method.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses an important problem: zero-shot generalization to novel symbolic rules without retraining.",
        "Proposes an integration of neural and symbolic methods, which is a relevant direction for improving interpretability and adaptability in reasoning tasks.",
        "Provides some analysis of failures and limitations, including domain mismatch and compositional generalization."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The contributions are incremental: the reported 3% improvement in accuracy (from 0.62 to 0.65) and modest shape-weighted accuracy gains are underwhelming and do not demonstrate clear superiority over existing methods.",
        "The methodology is not sufficiently novel; combining neural and symbolic approaches is well-studied, and the implementation details (e.g., adding symbolic features) are straightforward.",
        "Experimental evaluation is limited: only one dataset (SPR BENCH) is used, and the generalization claims are weakly supported. There is no comparison to stronger baselines or alternative architectures for SPR.",
        "Ablation studies lack depth: while symbolic features are shown to improve performance, deeper analysis of their contribution (e.g., interaction between symbolic and neural components) is missing.",
        "Clarity issues: important details, such as how symbolic features are computed or integrated during inference, are poorly explained. The paper requires significant rewriting to improve clarity and technical rigor.",
        "The practical impact of the proposed approach is unclear, as the reported gains are unlikely to motivate real-world adoption."

    "Questions": [
        "Can the authors provide a stronger justification for the limited performance improvement (3%)? Why does the proposed neural-symbolic integration fail to generalize better to unseen rules?",
        "How are symbolic features computed and integrated into the model during inference? Can this process be explicitly detailed?",
        "Why is the evaluation restricted to a single dataset? Could additional benchmarks or real-world datasets strengthen the claims?",
        "What specific steps could improve the compositional generalization or reduce the domain mismatch observed in the experiments?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not adequately address the broader challenges of zero-shot reasoning, such as significant domain shifts or complex compositional rules.",
        "The evaluation is limited to one dataset, which restricts the generality and impact of the study.",
        "The interpretability gains of the proposed approach are not well-demonstrated or quantified."
