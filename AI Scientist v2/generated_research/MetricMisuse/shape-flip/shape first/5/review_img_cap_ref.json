    "figure_1": {
        "Img_description": "The figure contains two subplots. Subplot (a) shows loss and RCWA curves over epochs with a dual y-axis: left for loss and right for RCWA. Subplot (b) shows test accuracy as a function of an unspecified variable, likely epochs. Loss decreases initially but plateaus early around 0.4-0.5, while RCWA remains below 0.77. Test accuracy in subplot (b) stalls around 0.62.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is generally informative but has room for improvement. Subplot (a) should clarify which curve corresponds to loss versus RCWA in the legend. Subplot (b) needs a labeled x-axis for clarity. Consistent font sizes and improved layout would enhance readability.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption aligns with the plots but lacks detail about the trend in loss observed in subplot (a). It could be expanded slightly to highlight that loss decreases initially and then plateaus. The description is otherwise concise and informative.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text has no references to Figure 1, which is a significant oversight. Proper figrefs are essential for integrating the figure into the paper and providing context and interpretation for the results shown."
    },
    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The figure contains two subplots: (a) a line graph showing training and validation loss over epochs alongside SWA curves, and (b) a bar chart showing the final test accuracy, which reaches about 0.65.",
        "Img_review": "Subplot (a) uses overlapping plots that are difficult to discern clearly. A legend or improved differentiation (e.g., color coding or line styles) is necessary. Subplot (b) is simplistic and lacks comparative context, such as a baseline or additional bars. Overall, the figure could be more informative with better organization and clarity.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption moderately describes the figure but lacks precision. It should explicitly connect specific subplots to the claims (e.g., trends in loss and SWA in subplot (a) and test accuracy in subplot (b)). The term 'shape-weighted accuracy' is not clearly reflected in the figure, leading to potential ambiguity.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text does not reference the figure at all, making it difficult to understand its purpose or relevance. Proper references should be included to describe the specific insights from each subplot and their connection to the paper's claims."
    },
    "figure_3": {
        "Img_description": "The figure comprises three subplots. The first (left) is a line graph comparing accuracy over epochs between a model with symbolic vectors and one without. The second (middle) is a line graph comparing loss over epochs for the same two models. The third (right) is a confusion matrix showing increased off-diagonal confusion for the 'No Symbolic Vectors' model.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is mostly clear and supports the paper's claim. However, the confusion matrix lacks a color bar, which would enhance interpretability. The line graphs are well-labeled and include legends but could benefit from slightly larger font sizes for readability.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption is accurate but too brief, only describing the overall takeaway and omitting details about the specific subplots. It should be expanded to summarize the insights from each subplot concisely.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the confusion matrix but does not mention the accuracy and loss plots. It should be revised to provide a holistic explanation of all subplots in the figure, not just the confusion matrix."
