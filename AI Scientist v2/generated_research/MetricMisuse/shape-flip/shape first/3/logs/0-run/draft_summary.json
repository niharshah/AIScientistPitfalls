  "Experiment_description": "The experiments involved establishing a baseline for Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR) using a neural bag-of-embeddings MLP model. Sequences of shape and color tokens were embedded and classified, focusing on metrics such as Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), and their harmonic mean (HWA).",
  "Significance": "These experiments are crucial as they set a neural baseline for SPR tasks, providing insights into the model's ability to generalize and recognize patterns. They pave the way for integrating symbolic components to enhance zero-shot generalization, contributing to advancements in sequence-classification tasks.",
  "Description": "The methods involved embedding sequences of shape and color tokens and using a neural bag-of-embeddings MLP model for classification. Metrics tracked included cross-entropy loss, SWA, CWA, and HWA. The experiments adhered to device guidelines, running on GPU when available.",
