  "current_findings": "## Comprehensive Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n### Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n1. **Neural-Symbolic Coupling**: The successful integration of a light Transformer encoder with auxiliary multi-task objectives has shown to strengthen neural-symbolic coupling. This design effectively leverages both neural and symbolic features, resulting in high Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA).\n\n2. **Auxiliary Tasks**: Incorporating auxiliary tasks, such as regressing to true shape- and color-variety counts, helps the model internalize rule-relevant statistics, which enhances performance without significant computational overhead.\n\n3. **Dynamic Padding and Sequence Handling**: Transitioning from fixed sequence truncation to dynamic, per-batch padding has resolved issues related to information loss, especially in longer sequences. This adjustment ensures that all tokens are preserved, improving model accuracy.\n\n4. **Multi-Synthetic-Dataset Training (MSDT)**: Training on lexically-perturbed datasets in parallel has demonstrated robustness and improved generalization across different test splits, maintaining high SWA and test accuracy.\n\n5. **Early Stopping and Evaluation Metrics**: Consistent use of early stopping based on validation performance, particularly focusing on SWA, has effectively prevented overfitting and ensured efficient training.\n\n### Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n1. **Overfitting**: A recurring issue across failed experiments is overfitting, where models achieve high validation SWA but significantly lower test SWA. This indicates that the models are not generalizing well to unseen data.\n\n2. **Lack of Regularization**: Experiments without regularization techniques such as dropout or weight decay often suffer from overfitting. The absence of these techniques leads to models that perform well on training and validation data but poorly on test data.\n\n3. **Fixed Embeddings**: Freezing the embedding layer results in poor generalization, as the model cannot adapt its representations to the nuances of the data, leading to lower test performance.\n\n4. **Insufficient Data Diversity**: Limited diversity in training data can lead to models that do not generalize well. This is evident in experiments where the test SWA is significantly lower than the validation SWA.\n\n### Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n1. **Enhance Regularization**: Implement regularization techniques such as dropout, weight decay, and early stopping based on test performance to mitigate overfitting. These techniques should be standard practice in future experiments.\n\n2. **Dynamic Sequence Handling**: Continue using dynamic, per-batch padding to ensure all tokens are preserved, especially in datasets with varying sequence lengths. This approach has proven effective in maintaining high accuracy.\n\n3. **Expand Data Diversity**: Increase the diversity of training data through data augmentation or by incorporating more varied synthetic datasets. This can help improve the model's generalization capabilities.\n\n4. **Cross-Validation**: Employ cross-validation to obtain a more robust evaluation of the model's performance. This approach can help identify overfitting issues early and ensure that the model generalizes well across different data splits.\n\n5. **Regular Monitoring and Logging**: Maintain comprehensive logging of all metrics and losses throughout the training process. This practice aids in diagnosing issues and understanding the model's behavior across different stages of training.\n\nBy addressing these areas, future experiments can build on the successes observed and mitigate the common pitfalls encountered, leading to more robust and generalizable models."
