  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Simple Neural Baseline**: Successful experiments utilized a straightforward neural architecture, treating the task as a sequence classification problem. The use of a bag-of-embeddings model with a small MLP was effective in achieving reasonable accuracy metrics.\n\n- **Metric Tracking**: Successful experiments consistently tracked training and validation losses, as well as shape-weighted accuracy (SWA), color-weighted accuracy (CWA), and their harmonic mean (HWA). This comprehensive metric tracking allowed for a clear understanding of model performance.\n\n- **Device Utilization**: Adhering to device guidelines by moving models, inputs, and loss tensors to GPU when available contributed to the success of the experiments, ensuring efficient computation and resource utilization.\n\n- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Establishing a complete end-to-end pipeline from data loading to evaluation was a key factor in successful experiments. This approach ensured that all components of the experiment were integrated and functioning correctly.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Missing Directories and Files**: A recurring issue in failed experiments was the absence of necessary directories or files, such as the SPR_BENCH directory or CSV files. This led to execution failures and highlights the importance of verifying the presence and correct placement of all required resources.\n\n- **Module Import Errors**: Several failed experiments encountered `ModuleNotFoundError` due to missing modules like 'SPR'. This indicates a need for careful management of the environment and ensuring that all dependencies and modules are correctly installed and accessible.\n\n- **Assumptions About Environment**: Some failures were due to assumptions about the environment, such as the availability of certain directories or modules. This underscores the need for robust error handling and environment checks in the experimental setup.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Environment and Resource Verification**: Before running experiments, verify the presence of all necessary directories, files, and modules. Implement checks in the script to confirm that the environment is correctly set up, and provide clear error messages if resources are missing.\n\n- **Dependency Management**: Ensure that all dependencies, including external modules like 'SPR', are correctly installed and included in the Python path. Consider using virtual environments or containerization to manage dependencies consistently.\n\n- **Robust Pipeline Development**: Continue to develop and refine end-to-end pipelines that integrate data loading, model training, and evaluation. This will help in identifying issues early and ensuring that all components work together seamlessly.\n\n- **Iterative Improvement**: Build on the successful simple neural baseline by gradually introducing more complex neural-symbolic components. This iterative approach allows for controlled experimentation and understanding of the impact of each change.\n\n- **Comprehensive Metric Analysis**: Maintain the practice of tracking a wide range of metrics to gain insights into model performance. Consider adding additional metrics or analyses to capture different aspects of the model's behavior.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations and learning from both successful and failed experiments, future research can be more efficient and yield better results."
