    "Summary": "The paper discusses several pitfalls encountered in deploying deep learning models in a production environment, focusing on issues such as distribution shifts and domain-specific constraints. It highlights the discrepancies between offline and live performance and aims to caution practitioners about these challenges.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper addresses a practical and important problem in the field of deep learning: the deployment of models under real-world conditions.",
        "The authors attempt to analyze the gap between offline and live performance, which is a relevant concern in industry."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper lacks originality as it does not propose any novel methods or frameworks to tackle the identified issues.",
        "The methodology is vague and does not provide sufficient details about the experimental setup, data collection, or analysis. For example, the description of the domain-specific adaptations and training curricula is superficial.",
        "The experimental results are minimal and do not provide sufficient insights or actionable conclusions. The performance differences reported are small and not thoroughly analyzed.",
        "The references are incomplete, with placeholders such as '***?' indicating a lack of thorough literature review.",
        "The clarity of the paper is poor, with vague descriptions and insufficient supporting details. The discussion of results is shallow, and the paper does not adequately connect findings to broader implications or actionable recommendations.",
        "The paper does not adequately address limitations or ethical considerations, nor does it propose any solutions to the identified pitfalls."

    "Questions": [
        "What specific domain-specific adaptations and training curricula were used, and why were they chosen?",
        "Can the authors provide more detailed descriptions of the experimental setup, including the proprietary dataset and the evaluation metrics?",
        "What insights or recommendations can be drawn from the reported results, and how can practitioners address the identified pitfalls?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not adequately address its limitations, such as the narrow scope of experiments, the lack of generality of findings, and the absence of proposed solutions.",
        "No discussion of potential ethical concerns or societal impacts is provided, which is especially important for real-world deployments of AI systems."
