  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Disentangled Representation**: The successful experiments often utilized a disentangled representation of shape and color, which facilitated the detection of novel rule patterns. This approach, combined with a light Transformer, provided richer context and improved zero-shot rule induction.\n\n- **Symbolic Feature Integration**: Incorporating symbolic features, such as the number of unique shapes or colors, consistently enhanced model performance. This integration allowed the model to leverage both neural and symbolic reasoning.\n\n- **Transformer Utilization**: The use of a Transformer encoder, even in a simplified form, consistently contributed to high accuracy across various datasets. The Transformer provided sequence-level contextual modeling that was crucial for the model's success.\n\n- **Early Stopping and Regularization**: Implementing early stopping and regularization techniques helped prevent overfitting and ensured that the model maintained high performance on validation and test datasets.\n\n- **Robust Data Handling**: Ensuring that the data pipeline could handle missing or synthetic datasets without errors was a key factor in the success of the experiments. This robustness allowed for consistent execution and evaluation of the models.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Dataset Generation Errors**: A common failure point was the incorrect generation of datasets, particularly when creating synthetic datasets with missing splits (e.g., train, dev). This led to execution errors and hindered model evaluation.\n\n- **Zero-Shot Rule Generalization**: Despite high accuracy on known datasets, models often struggled with zero-shot rule generalization, indicating a limitation in the model's ability to apply learned rules to unseen scenarios.\n\n- **Over-Reliance on Specific Modalities**: Some ablations showed that removing certain modalities, like color, did not significantly impact performance, suggesting that the model may be overly reliant on specific features rather than truly understanding the underlying rules.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Generalization Capabilities**: Focus on improving the model's ability to generalize to unseen rules. This could involve experimenting with more diverse training datasets or incorporating techniques that encourage rule abstraction.\n\n- **Improve Dataset Handling**: Ensure that dataset generation scripts are robust and can handle cases where certain splits are not required. Consider implementing checks or logic to handle missing data gracefully.\n\n- **Explore Alternative Pooling Strategies**: While mean pooling and [CLS] token aggregation were effective, exploring other aggregation strategies might yield further improvements in model performance and generalization.\n\n- **Balance Neural and Symbolic Features**: Continue to explore the balance between neural network capabilities and symbolic reasoning. This could involve experimenting with different ways of integrating symbolic features or testing new symbolic statistics.\n\n- **Monitor Zero-Shot Performance**: Regularly evaluate zero-shot rule generalization scores during experiments to identify potential weaknesses in the model's design or training process early on.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations and building on the successful patterns observed, future experiments can achieve more robust and generalizable models."
