  "current_findings": "### Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Minimal Neural Baseline**: The successful experiments utilized a minimal neural baseline that effectively classified SPR sequences directly from raw token strings. This approach involved a simple architecture: token embedding followed by a bidirectional GRU, mean-pooling, and a linear classifier. This setup proved effective in learning from the data and achieving reasonable accuracy metrics.\n\n- **Reproducibility and Self-Containment**: Successful experiments emphasized reproducibility by ensuring that the entire pipeline, from data loading to evaluation, was self-contained. This included auto-generating synthetic datasets if the main dataset was missing, ensuring that the code could run independently and consistently.\n\n- **Efficient Use of Resources**: The experiments were designed to efficiently use available resources, such as moving all tensors and models to GPU when available. This optimization contributed to better performance and faster training times.\n\n- **Consistent Metric Tracking**: The experiments consistently tracked and logged metrics such as training and validation loss, as well as harmonic weighted accuracy (HWA). This allowed for clear monitoring of model performance and facilitated iterative improvements.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Dataset Path Issues**: A recurring issue in failed experiments was the incorrect specification of dataset paths, leading to `FileNotFoundError`. This suggests a need for careful management of file paths and ensuring that datasets are correctly located or paths are accurately specified in scripts.\n\n- **Module Import Errors**: Some experiments failed due to `ModuleNotFoundError`, indicating that necessary modules or files (e.g., SPR.py) were not correctly placed or named. This highlights the importance of verifying the presence and correct naming of all required files.\n\n- **Synthetic Data Generation Errors**: Errors in generating synthetic datasets, such as `SchemaInferenceError`, occurred when the dataset structure was not correctly defined. This suggests a need for careful handling of dataset schema and ensuring that synthetic data generation is robust and well-tested.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Robust Path Management**: Ensure that all dataset paths are correctly specified and that datasets are placed in the expected directories. Consider implementing checks or prompts to guide users in setting up the correct paths.\n\n- **Module and File Verification**: Before execution, verify that all necessary modules and files are present and correctly named. Implement automated checks to ensure that all dependencies are satisfied.\n\n- **Synthetic Data Handling**: Improve the synthetic data generation process by explicitly defining dataset schemas and testing the generation process separately before integration. This will prevent errors related to dataset structure and ensure that fallback mechanisms work as intended.\n\n- **Iterative Enhancement**: Build on the successful minimal neural baseline by gradually incorporating more complex neural-symbolic techniques. This approach allows for controlled experimentation and easier identification of improvements.\n\n- **Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring**: Continue the practice of detailed logging and monitoring of metrics to facilitate analysis and debugging. This will aid in identifying trends and issues early in the experimental process.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes and avoid the pitfalls encountered in previous attempts, leading to more robust and effective experimental outcomes."
