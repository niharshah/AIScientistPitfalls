  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Neural-Symbolic Hybrid Approach**: The integration of a small Transformer encoder with explicit symbolic feature vectors (e.g., sequence length, shape-variety, colour-variety) has proven highly effective. This combination allows the model to generalize zero-shot to unseen shape rules, as evidenced by the baseline achieving near-perfect validation shape-weighted accuracy (SWA) of 0.9971.\n\n- **Ablation Studies**: Several ablations demonstrated the robustness of the model design:\n  - **Remove-Positional-Encoding** and **Token-Order-Shuffling**: Both ablations maintained high validation SWA (0.9447), indicating that the model can still perform well without relying heavily on positional information.\n  - **Max-Pooling-Sequence-Representation**: This alternative pooling strategy achieved an impressive validation SWA of 0.9994, suggesting that max pooling can be a viable alternative to mean pooling in certain contexts.\n\n- **Early Stopping and Metric-Driven Training**: Consistent use of early stopping based on validation SWA helped prevent overfitting and ensured efficient training across experiments.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Overfitting to Training/Validation Data**: Several experiments, such as the **Remove-Symbolic-Features** ablation, showed excellent performance on the development set but poor generalization to the test set. This indicates a tendency to overfit, especially when symbolic features are removed.\n\n- **Data Handling Issues**: The **Multi-Dataset Training Ablation** failed due to a missing dataset, highlighting the importance of robust data handling and error-checking mechanisms in experimental setups.\n\n- **Generalization to Unseen Combinations**: The experiment addressing unseen shape-color combinations failed to improve Unseen-Combo Accuracy (UCA), remaining at 0.0000. This suggests a need for better handling of novel combinations, possibly through data augmentation or architectural changes.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Generalization**: To address overfitting and improve generalization, consider implementing regularization techniques such as dropout or weight decay. Additionally, augmenting the training data with synthetic examples, especially for unseen shape-color combinations, could enhance model robustness.\n\n- **Improve Data Handling**: Ensure all datasets are correctly located and accessible before running experiments. Implement error-checking mechanisms to handle missing data gracefully, possibly by skipping unavailable datasets or providing default fallbacks.\n\n- **Architectural Adjustments**: For experiments involving unseen combinations, explore more expressive reasoning modules that can capture relationships between shape and color features. Factorizing tokens into independent sub-symbols and learning separate embeddings for each could also improve performance.\n\n- **Metric and Objective Reevaluation**: Consider revisiting the loss function or training objectives to explicitly penalize poor performance on critical metrics like UCA. This could drive the model to focus more on generalizing to unseen combinations.\n\nBy addressing these areas, future experiments can build on the successes observed while mitigating common pitfalls, ultimately leading to more robust and generalizable models."
