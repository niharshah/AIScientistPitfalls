  "Experiment_description": "The experiments focus on the Symbolic Pattern Recognition task using neural-symbolic models. The baseline approach uses a 'bag-of-symbols' model, while other nodes employ GRU-based models for sequence classification, evaluating their performance on accuracy and novel rule generalization.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are crucial for understanding the effectiveness of neural-symbolic approaches in sequence classification, particularly in tasks requiring generalization to novel inputs. The findings indicate that sequence modeling with GRUs significantly enhances performance, providing a pathway for developing more robust models in similar tasks.",
  "Description": "The experiments involve training neural-symbolic models on the SPR task, with varying approaches to token embedding and sequence processing. The baseline uses a simple averaging method, while others implement GRUs. Models are evaluated on accuracy, shape-weighted and color-weighted accuracy, and novel rule generalization. Training employs cross-entropy loss with the Adam optimizer, and evaluation metrics are recorded and analyzed.",
