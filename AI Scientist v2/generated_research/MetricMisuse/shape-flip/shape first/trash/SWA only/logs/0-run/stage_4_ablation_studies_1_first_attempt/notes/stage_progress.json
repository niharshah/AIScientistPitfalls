  "current_findings": "## Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Neural-Symbolic Fusion**: The integration of symbolic features with neural networks, specifically through a light neural-symbolic fusion approach, consistently yielded high performance. By embedding symbolic features alongside GRU hidden states, models achieved perfect accuracy and shape-weighted accuracy across training, validation, and test datasets.\n\n- **Ablation Studies**: The experiments demonstrated the importance of symbolic features. Removing the symbolic branch or using randomized symbolic input led to significant drops in performance, highlighting the value of meaningful symbolic content.\n\n- **Robustness to Token Order**: The model's performance remained unaffected when token order was shuffled, indicating that the neural-symbolic architecture effectively captured the necessary information without relying on sequential cues.\n\n- **Generalization Across Datasets**: The model successfully generalized across different synthetic datasets, maintaining high accuracy and shape-weighted accuracy even when trained, validated, and tested on distinct datasets. This suggests a strong ability to abstract and generalize rules beyond the training data.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Ignoring Symbolic Features**: Experiments that ignored symbolic features, such as the \"Remove-Symbolic-Branch\" and \"Randomized-Symbolic-Input\" ablations, showed reduced performance. This indicates that symbolic features are crucial for capturing rule-level statistics and achieving high accuracy.\n\n- **Over-reliance on Token Embeddings**: The \"Remove-RNN-Branch\" ablation, which relied solely on symbolic features, still achieved perfect accuracy, suggesting that while token embeddings are useful, they are not solely responsible for the model's success. Over-reliance on them without symbolic integration could lead to suboptimal performance.\n\n- **Loss of Equality Feature**: Removing the equality feature led to a noticeable drop in performance, emphasizing its importance in the symbolic feature set.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Symbolic Integration**: Future experiments should continue to explore and enhance the integration of symbolic features with neural networks. This could involve experimenting with different types of symbolic features or more sophisticated fusion techniques.\n\n- **Balance Between Neural and Symbolic Components**: While symbolic features are crucial, maintaining a balance between neural and symbolic components is important. Future experiments could explore dynamic weighting or adaptive mechanisms to balance these components based on the task.\n\n- **Explore Robustness to Input Variations**: Given the model's robustness to token order, future work could explore other input variations, such as noise or missing data, to further test the model's generalization capabilities.\n\n- **Investigate Feature Importance**: Conducting more detailed ablation studies to understand the importance of individual symbolic features can guide the design of more efficient and effective models.\n\n- **Cross-Dataset Generalization**: Further research into cross-dataset generalization could provide insights into the model's ability to learn abstract rules and apply them to unseen data, potentially leading to more robust AI systems.\n\nBy leveraging these insights, future experiments can build on the successes observed and avoid common pitfalls, ultimately leading to more powerful and generalizable AI models."
