We will load experiment_data.npy, infer the single dataset key (expected “SPR_BENCH”), and safely extract losses, epoch-wise dev metrics, final test metrics, predictions, and ground-truth labels. Using basic matplotlib, we will create up to five figures: 1) training vs. validation loss curves, 2) validation accuracy/SWA/CWA curves, 3) a bar chart summarizing final test metrics (ACC, SWA, CWA, NRGS), 4) a confusion-matrix style heat-map for test predictions, and 5) an optional histogram of prediction confidence if logits were stored (plotted only if such data exist). Each plot is wrapped in an independent try-except block; figures are saved with descriptive names that include the dataset and plot type, titles include clear subtitles, and all figures are closed after saving. We also print the final numerical test metrics and NRGS for quick inspection. The entire routine resides in a single concise script beginning with the mandated imports and creation of the working directory.
