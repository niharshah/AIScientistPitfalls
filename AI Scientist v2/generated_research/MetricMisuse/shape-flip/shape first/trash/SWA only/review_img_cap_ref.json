        "Img_description": "Figure 1 contains two subfigures: (a) 'Training curves and final metrics,' and (b) 'Confusion matrix on validation.' Both subfigures are represented by placeholders ('research_curves.png' and 'research_test_metrics_and_cm.png'), so no actual data or visuals are present.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is well-structured with clear subfigure labels. However, the absence of actual data or visuals severely limits its utility and prevents evaluation of its alignment with the intended message. The placeholders must be replaced with the actual content to make the figure meaningful.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption is concise and scientific, describing the intended insight from the figure. However, without the actual visuals, its accuracy and relevance cannot be assessed. It could be slightly expanded to explicitly reference both subfigures and clarify their respective roles.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The references in the main text provide a clear context for the figure, describing its purpose and intended insights. However, their effectiveness depends on the inclusion of meaningful content in the subfigures, which is currently missing."
    },
    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The image is a placeholder with the text 'ablation_remove_symbolic_branch.png' and does not contain any scientific data or visual content.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is missing entirely, so it is impossible to evaluate its quality, clarity, or alignment with the caption. Including the actual figure is essential for proper analysis.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption claims that removing the symbolic branch leads to a significant performance drop across multiple seeds. While concise and including a key takeaway, it cannot be validated or critiqued without the actual figure.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references Figure 2 and provides context about its intended purpose, highlighting the importance of the symbolic branch for robust generalization. However, the absence of the figure makes it impossible to assess the validity of these claims."
    },
    "figure_3": {
        "Img_description": "The image is a placeholder containing only the text 'ablation_freeze_embedding_learning.png'. It does not display any scientific content, such as graphs, charts, or data visualizations.",
        "Img_review": "The provided image does not contain any meaningful information for analysis. It is likely a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual figure that corresponds to the caption. Without a proper figure, no evaluation or suggestions for improvement can be made.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption, 'Freezing embeddings impacts generalization stability,' cannot be assessed against the image because the image does not contain relevant information. The caption should be reviewed in the context of the actual figure when provided.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references are empty, and without a proper figure, it is impossible to determine how well the figure is integrated into the text. The authors should ensure that the figure is correctly referenced and its relevance is explained in the main text."

    "figure_4": {
        "Img_description": "The figure is a placeholder with the filename 'ablation_multi_synth_generalization.png' written in the center. No content such as charts, plots, labels, or legends is present.",
        "Img_review": "The figure contains no substantive content, making it impossible to extract or analyze the intended visualization. It should be replaced with a meaningful figure that includes relevant visual information, such as plots or diagrams illustrating multi-synthetic input scaling and failure modes.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption, 'Multi-synthetic input: scaling to more varied tasks reveals new failure modes,' suggests the figure is meant to illustrate scaling across tasks and associated failure modes. However, the placeholder figure lacks content, making it impossible to evaluate alignment. The caption should include a concise takeaway once the figure is updated.",
        "Figrefs_review": "References to the figure in the main text are not provided. The main text should include clear explanations of the figure's purpose, context, and key insights, particularly regarding the methodology and examples of failure modes observed."

        "Img_description": "The provided image is a placeholder with the text 'ablation_randomized_symbolic_input.png' and contains no visual data, graphs, or meaningful content.",
        "Img_review": "The image does not contain any graphical content and cannot be evaluated. The figure should be included with proper visual data, such as a graph or chart, to substantiate the claim in the caption.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption suggests that randomizing symbolic inputs results in large drops in accuracy. However, without the actual figure, it is impossible to verify or assess the accuracy and relevance of this claim. The caption appears concise but lacks sufficient context.",
        "Figrefs_review": "There are no references to the figure in the main text ('[]'). This is a significant issue, as figures should be integrated into the narrative with clear explanations and context. Proper references must be added to explain the purpose and findings of the figure."

    "figure_6": {
        "Img_description": "The figure is a placeholder or unrendered file with the filename 'ablation_remove_equality_feature.png'. No visual data, graphs, or meaningful content are present.",
        "Img_review": "The figure does not contain any meaningful content to analyze. It appears to be a placeholder, and as such, it lacks labeled axes, legends, or any visualization that conveys information. It is essential to include a properly rendered figure with relevant data to support the paper's claims.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption, 'Removing equality features intensifies class confusion,' cannot be assessed for alignment due to the lack of meaningful content in the figure. A concise and accurate caption should accompany a properly rendered visualization.",
        "Figrefs_review": "No references to the figure are provided in the main text ([]). This omission makes it impossible to assess whether the figure is adequately explained or integrated into the paper's arguments. Proper figure references should be added to contextualize and explain the figure's purpose and findings."

    "figure_7": {
        "Img_description": "The image is a blank placeholder containing only the text 'ablation_token_order_shuffled_input.png', which appears to be the filename of the intended figure.",
        "Img_review": "The figure itself is absent, presenting no visual data or information. This prevents any meaningful analysis or critique of its content, design, or relevance. If this is a rendering error, it should be corrected to include the actual figure. Without this, the figure fails to contribute to the paper.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption suggests the figure should demonstrate that shuffling token order affects symbolic reasoning, but this cannot be verified due to the lack of figure content. While the caption is concise, its accuracy and relevance cannot be assessed without the actual figure.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references to the figure are entirely missing ('[]'). This omission makes it impossible to evaluate how the figure is integrated into the paper or whether its purpose is adequately explained. Proper figrefs should be added and contextualized within the manuscript."
