    "Summary": "The paper investigates shortcomings in symbolic reasoning tasks using hybrid architectures that combine trainable embeddings and symbolic processing branches. It documents how small changes in training data or architecture can drastically degrade performance. The authors present negative findings and caution practitioners about pitfalls in designing robust pipelines for symbolic reasoning tasks.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper addresses a relevant and challenging area in symbolic reasoning, which remains an open problem in AI research.",
        "The documentation of negative findings can be valuable for practitioners aiming to deploy symbolic hybrid models in real-world settings."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper lacks novelty as it primarily documents negative results without proposing novel methods, architectures, or theoretical insights.",
        "The experimental section is underwhelming, with vague descriptions of the setup and insufficient clarity or depth in the analysis of results.",
        "The findings are not well contextualized within prior work, and the related work section is sparse and lacks proper citations.",
        "The methodology for investigating the failures is not rigorous or systematic enough to generalize the conclusions.",
        "The presentation of the results is poor, with incomplete descriptions of figures and insufficient discussion of their implications."

    "Questions": [
        "Could the authors clarify the exact setup of the symbolic branch and how it interacts with the embedding layer?",
        "What specific datasets and tasks were used for the experiments? The lack of detail hinders reproducibility.",
        "How do the findings compare quantitatively to other symbolic reasoning systems? Are there baselines or other benchmarks to contextualize the results?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The authors fail to adequately address the limitations of their work. For example, the scope of the findings is unclear, and there is no discussion of how the negative results can be mitigated or avoided in future systems.",
        "The potential societal impact of symbolic reasoning systems is not discussed, which could have been relevant given their applications."
