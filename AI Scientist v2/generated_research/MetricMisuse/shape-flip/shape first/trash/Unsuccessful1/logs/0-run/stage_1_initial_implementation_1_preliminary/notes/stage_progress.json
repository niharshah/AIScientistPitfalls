  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Simple Baseline Models**: Successful experiments often started with straightforward baseline models, such as GRU-based sequence classifiers or simple neural-symbolic hybrids (Embedding \u2192 MeanPool \u2192 Linear). These models provided a solid foundation for further experimentation.\n\n- **Tokenization and Vocabulary Building**: Tokenizing sequences into discrete symbols and building a vocabulary from the training split were consistent steps in successful experiments. This approach helped in effectively mapping input sequences to integer IDs for model processing.\n\n- **Device Handling**: All successful experiments ensured that tensors and models were moved to GPU when available, adhering to device handling guidelines. This optimized performance and reduced training time.\n\n- **Metric Tracking**: Continuous monitoring of key metrics like Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), and their harmonic mean (HWA) was crucial. These metrics were tracked across training, validation, and test phases to assess model performance comprehensively.\n\n- **Data Handling and Storage**: Successful experiments consistently stored metrics, losses, predictions, and ground-truth labels in structured data formats (e.g., .npy files) for later analysis. This facilitated easy comparison and evaluation of different models.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Data Column Handling**: A common failure was the removal of essential data columns (e.g., 'sequence') during encoding, leading to KeyErrors during validation. This issue arose when the original columns were replaced without retaining necessary information for later stages.\n\n- **Error in Validation Loop**: Attempts to access non-existent columns in the dataset during validation caused execution failures. This was typically due to changes in the dataset structure that were not accounted for in the validation code.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Maintain Data Integrity**: Ensure that all necessary data columns are retained throughout the data processing pipeline. If columns are replaced or transformed, store the original data separately for future access.\n\n- **Robust Error Handling**: Implement checks and error handling mechanisms to prevent KeyErrors and similar issues. This includes verifying the presence of required columns before accessing them in the code.\n\n- **Iterative Model Development**: Start with simple baseline models and iteratively introduce more complex neural-symbolic ideas. This approach allows for a clear understanding of the impact of each modification.\n\n- **Comprehensive Metric Analysis**: Continue to track a variety of metrics across different phases of model training and evaluation. This provides a holistic view of model performance and highlights areas for improvement.\n\n- **Consistent Data Management**: Maintain a structured approach to data storage and management, ensuring that all relevant information is saved for future analysis and comparison.\n\nBy following these recommendations and learning from both successful and failed experiments, future research can build on existing progress and develop more sophisticated models with improved performance."
