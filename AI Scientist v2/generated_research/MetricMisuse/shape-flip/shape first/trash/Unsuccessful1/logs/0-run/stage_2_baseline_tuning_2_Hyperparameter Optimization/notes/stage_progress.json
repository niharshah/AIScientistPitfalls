  "current_findings": "### Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Successful experiments consistently involved systematic hyperparameter tuning, such as adjusting batch size, embedding dimensions, and weight decay. These experiments recorded detailed metrics (training/validation loss, SWA, CWA, HWA) and stored results systematically for analysis.\n\n- **Metric-Driven Checkpointing:** Switching from early-stopping based on validation loss to tracking and maximizing Harmonic-Weighted Accuracy (HWA) led to improved model performance. This approach ensured that the model parameters were optimal for the task-specific metric rather than just numerically stable.\n\n- **Structured Experimentation:** Successful experiments maintained a structured approach, with clear documentation and organization of results. This included saving results in a hierarchical dictionary format and ensuring all data was persisted to disk.\n\n- **Consistent Evaluation:** All successful experiments included consistent evaluation on both development and test sets, ensuring that the models were not overfitting to the training data.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Lack of Detailed Logging:** Several failed experiments lacked detailed logs or metrics, making it difficult to understand the outcomes or diagnose issues. This was a common issue in experiments involving learning rate and vocabulary minimum frequency tuning.\n\n- **Execution Errors:** Some experiments failed due to execution errors, such as missing dataset files or incorrect file paths. This was evident in the experiment where the dataset path was incorrectly specified, leading to a FileNotFoundError.\n\n- **Inadequate Script Execution:** Experiments that failed to execute properly often had issues with script structure, such as improper use of the `if __name__ == '__main__'` guard, which prevented the script from running when imported by an external runner.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Logging and Monitoring:** Ensure that all experiments include comprehensive logging of training and validation losses, evaluation metrics, and hyperparameter settings. This will facilitate better understanding and analysis of results.\n\n- **Robust Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch and log exceptions, such as FileNotFoundError, and provide meaningful error messages. This will help in quickly diagnosing and fixing issues related to dataset paths or missing files.\n\n- **Automate Hyperparameter Search:** Consider automating hyperparameter search using tools like grid search or Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space and identify optimal settings.\n\n- **Focus on Task-Specific Metrics:** Continue to prioritize task-specific metrics, such as HWA, for checkpointing and model evaluation. This ensures that the models are optimized for the specific goals of the task.\n\n- **Ensure Script Compatibility:** Review and update scripts to ensure compatibility with different execution environments. This includes removing unnecessary execution guards and verifying that all necessary files and dependencies are correctly specified and accessible.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes observed and mitigate common pitfalls, leading to more reliable and insightful experimental outcomes."
