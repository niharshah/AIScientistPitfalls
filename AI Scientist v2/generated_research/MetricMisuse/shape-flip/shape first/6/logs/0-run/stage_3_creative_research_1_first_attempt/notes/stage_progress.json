  "current_findings": "### Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Neural-Symbolic Integration**: Many successful experiments utilized a hybrid approach, combining neural networks (e.g., GRU, Transformer) with symbolic features. This integration allowed models to leverage both contextual information and explicit rule-level cues, enhancing zero-shot generalization.\n\n- **Early Stopping and Hyperparameter Tuning**: Implementing early stopping based on validation loss or Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) was a common strategy that helped prevent overfitting and ensured the best model performance. Hyperparameter tuning, such as adjusting the number of epochs, also contributed to improved outcomes.\n\n- **Symbolic Feature Engineering**: Successful designs often included symbolic features like the number of distinct shapes and colors, which provided additional rule-level information. These features were processed through small MLPs and concatenated with neural outputs, improving model accuracy.\n\n- **Lightweight Models**: Many experiments favored lightweight models, such as small Transformers or GRUs, which were efficient and effective. These models were often paired with symbolic features to maintain performance while reducing computational complexity.\n\n- **Comprehensive Logging and Evaluation**: Successful experiments consistently logged metrics, losses, and predictions, which facilitated thorough evaluation and comparison. Metrics like SWA were prioritized, focusing on structurally richer samples.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Over-reliance on Neural Components**: Experiments that did not incorporate symbolic features or relied solely on neural networks often struggled with zero-shot generalization, highlighting the importance of integrating symbolic reasoning.\n\n- **Inadequate Hyperparameter Optimization**: Some experiments may have failed due to insufficient hyperparameter tuning, leading to suboptimal model performance. Not adjusting learning rates, batch sizes, or other parameters can hinder results.\n\n- **Complexity without Justification**: Introducing complex architectures or features without clear justification or understanding of their impact can lead to unnecessary complications and potential performance degradation.\n\n- **Neglecting Evaluation Metrics**: Focusing solely on traditional metrics like accuracy without considering task-specific metrics (e.g., SWA) can result in misleading evaluations, especially in tasks requiring zero-shot generalization.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Neural-Symbolic Synergy**: Continue exploring and refining neural-symbolic hybrid models. Consider incorporating richer symbolic features, such as rule signatures or positional color histograms, to further improve generalization.\n\n- **Prioritize Task-Specific Metrics**: Focus on metrics that align with the task's goals, such as SWA for zero-shot generalization tasks. This ensures that models are evaluated based on their ability to handle complex, unseen scenarios.\n\n- **Optimize Hyperparameters**: Implement systematic hyperparameter tuning strategies, such as grid search or Bayesian optimization, to identify optimal settings for each experiment.\n\n- **Simplify Where Possible**: Favor lightweight models and avoid unnecessary complexity unless it provides a clear advantage. This approach can reduce computational costs and improve model interpretability.\n\n- **Comprehensive Experimentation Framework**: Maintain thorough logging and evaluation practices. Ensure that all relevant metrics, predictions, and losses are recorded and analyzed to facilitate informed decision-making and iterative improvements.\n\nBy focusing on these key areas, future experiments can build on the successes observed while avoiding common pitfalls, ultimately leading to more robust and generalizable models."
