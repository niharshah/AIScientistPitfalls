    "Summary": "The paper explores the challenges of zero-shot generalization in neural-symbolic reasoning, focusing on overfitting, token biases, and architectural sensitivities. It provides negative results and ablation studies to highlight limitations in current architectures but does not propose new methodologies or robust solutions.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Identifies relevant challenges in zero-shot neural-symbolic reasoning, such as overfitting and poor generalization.",
        "Provides ablation studies to investigate the impact of architectural components like positional embeddings and pooling methods.",
        "Highlights the gap between training/validation performance and generalization to unseen symbolic rules."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "No novel methodology or framework is proposed to address the identified challenges.",
        "The experiments are limited to synthetic tasks, which lack real-world applicability or complexity.",
        "Negative results dominate the paper without providing actionable insights or significant contributions to the field.",
        "Details about the experimental setup, datasets, and metrics are insufficient for reproducibility.",
        "The writing lacks clarity and fails to provide a compelling narrative or justification for the study."
