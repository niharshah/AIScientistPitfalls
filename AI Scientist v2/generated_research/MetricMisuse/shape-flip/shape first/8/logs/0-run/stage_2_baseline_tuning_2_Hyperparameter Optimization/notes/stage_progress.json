  "current_findings": "## Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic exploration of hyperparameters such as `num_training_epochs`, `learning_rate`, `batch_size`, `hidden_size`, `weight_decay`, `dropout_rate`, `num_hidden_layers`, and `activation_function` led to significant improvements in model performance. For instance, increasing the number of epochs improved training and validation metrics, while tuning the learning rate and batch size optimized the balance between convergence speed and stability.\n\n- **Generalization and Unseen Rule Accuracy (URA)**: Across various experiments, the models consistently achieved a perfect score of 1.000 in URA, indicating strong generalization capabilities and robustness to unseen data.\n\n- **Data Logging and Organization**: Successful experiments involved meticulous logging of metrics and results, which were stored in structured formats like `experiment_data.npy`. This facilitated easy analysis and comparison across different configurations.\n\n- **Model Architecture Exploration**: Varying the model's architecture, such as the number of hidden layers and activation functions, provided insights into the impact of model complexity on performance. For example, increasing the depth of the MLP and experimenting with different activation functions like ReLU, LeakyReLU, GELU, and Tanh yielded valuable performance data.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Lack of Experimentation on Failed Experiments**: The absence of documented failed experiments limits the ability to identify specific pitfalls. However, common issues in machine learning experiments often include overfitting due to excessive model complexity or insufficient regularization, and underfitting due to overly simplistic models or insufficient training data.\n\n- **Inadequate Hyperparameter Exploration**: Not exploring a wide enough range of hyperparameters can lead to suboptimal model performance. It's crucial to cover a broad spectrum of values to identify the best configurations.\n\n- **Insufficient Data Logging**: Failing to log detailed metrics and results can hinder the ability to analyze and learn from experiments, making it difficult to replicate successes or understand failures.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Expand Hyperparameter Search**: Continue to explore a wide range of hyperparameters, including more granular values, to ensure optimal model performance. Consider using automated hyperparameter optimization techniques like Bayesian optimization or grid search.\n\n- **Document Failures**: Systematically document failed experiments to identify and learn from common pitfalls. This will provide a more comprehensive understanding of what doesn't work and why.\n\n- **Enhance Data Logging and Analysis**: Ensure all experiments are accompanied by detailed logging of metrics and results. Utilize visualization tools to analyze trends and patterns across different configurations.\n\n- **Focus on Generalization**: While achieving high accuracy on training and validation sets is important, prioritize models that maintain strong generalization to unseen data, as indicated by URA scores.\n\n- **Experiment with Regularization Techniques**: To prevent overfitting, explore various regularization techniques such as dropout, weight decay, and early stopping. Monitor their impact on both training and validation performance.\n\nBy building on these insights and recommendations, future experiments can be more strategic and effective, leading to continued improvements in model performance and robustness."
