  "current_findings": "## Comprehensive Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The experiment with varying `num_training_epochs` demonstrated that increasing the number of epochs generally improved both training and validation metrics, achieving perfect test URA scores across all configurations. This indicates that adequate training time is crucial for model performance.\n\n- **Ablation Studies**: Several ablation experiments provided insights into the importance of specific features:\n  - **No-Symbolic-Fallback**: The model performed well without fallback, achieving a test SWA of 0.924, suggesting that the neural network can independently generalize well.\n  - **No-Histogram Features**: Achieved a high test SWA of 0.997, indicating that global statistics alone can be highly effective.\n  - **Shape-Blind Encoding**: Achieved a test SWA of 0.966, showing that color features can compensate for the absence of shape features to some extent.\n  - **Length-Normalized Histogram Encoding**: Achieved a high test SWA of 0.980, suggesting that normalizing histograms by sequence length enhances performance.\n\n- **Generalization Across Datasets**: The Multi-Synthetic-Dataset Generalization experiment showed that training on one dataset and testing on another can still yield good performance, with a final SWA of 0.9067, highlighting the model's ability to generalize across different data distributions.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Over-reliance on Specific Features**: Some ablations, like No-Variety-Stats Encoding and No-Length-Feature Encoding, resulted in lower SWA scores (0.7641 and 0.8700, respectively), indicating that removing certain features can significantly degrade performance. This suggests that the model may be overly reliant on specific features for accurate predictions.\n\n- **Complexity vs. Simplicity**: The Linear-Only Model ablation, which replaced the MLP with a linear classifier, resulted in a lower SWA of 0.767. This demonstrates that reducing model complexity can lead to a drop in performance, emphasizing the need for a balance between model simplicity and complexity.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Further Hyperparameter Tuning**: Continue exploring other hyperparameters, such as learning rate and batch size, to identify optimal configurations that could further enhance model performance.\n\n- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Conduct more detailed analyses to understand the contribution of each feature to the model's performance. This can guide the design of more effective feature sets.\n\n- **Explore Hybrid Models**: Given the success of the symbolic fallback in some experiments, consider developing hybrid models that combine neural and symbolic approaches to leverage the strengths of both.\n\n- **Cross-Dataset Validation**: Implement more cross-dataset validation experiments to ensure the model's robustness and generalization capabilities across diverse data distributions.\n\n- **Incremental Complexity**: Gradually increase model complexity, such as adding more hidden layers or using advanced architectures, to assess the trade-offs between complexity and performance.\n\nBy leveraging these insights and recommendations, future experiments can be better designed to maximize model performance and generalization capabilities."
