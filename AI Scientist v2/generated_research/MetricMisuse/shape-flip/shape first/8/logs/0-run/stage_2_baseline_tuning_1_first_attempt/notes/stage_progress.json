  "current_findings": "### Comprehensive Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Baseline Establishment**: The initial lean neural-symbolic baseline effectively set a foundation for further experimentation. By converting sequences into explicit symbolic statistics and using a small two-layer MLP, the experiment achieved a strong initial performance, particularly in unseen-rule accuracy (URA).\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic tuning of hyperparameters such as epochs, batch size, and hidden dimensions led to significant improvements in model performance. Each tuning experiment was structured to reinitialize the model, train it under different configurations, and log detailed metrics, which allowed for precise evaluation and comparison.\n\n  - **Epoch Tuning**: By experimenting with different epoch budgets and employing early stopping, the model achieved optimal performance without overfitting.\n  \n  - **Batch Size Variation**: Adjusting the mini-batch size demonstrated a clear impact on training efficiency and accuracy, with larger batch sizes generally improving test accuracy and URA.\n  \n  - **Hidden Dimension Tuning**: Exploring various hidden layer sizes consistently yielded high URA scores, indicating robustness across configurations.\n\n- **Consistent Metrics Logging**: Across all successful experiments, detailed logging of metrics such as accuracy, loss, and URA at each epoch enabled thorough analysis and understanding of model behavior.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Lack of Error Analysis**: In the failed experiment involving learning rate tuning, there was no error analysis or debugging information provided. This lack of insight into potential issues can hinder understanding and resolution of failures.\n\n- **Inadequate Exploration of Learning Rates**: Although not explicitly mentioned as a failure, the absence of detailed results or improvements from the learning rate tuning suggests that the grid search might have been too limited or not effectively implemented.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Expand Hyperparameter Search Space**: While tuning hyperparameters, consider expanding the search space, especially for learning rates, to ensure a comprehensive exploration of potential configurations.\n\n- **Implement Robust Error Analysis**: For experiments that do not yield expected results, conduct a thorough error analysis to identify and understand the underlying issues. This should include debugging information and potential causes of failure.\n\n- **Leverage Successful Baseline**: Continue building on the successful neural-symbolic baseline by integrating more complex models or additional features, while maintaining the robust logging and evaluation framework.\n\n- **Focus on Generalization**: Given the consistent success in achieving high URA scores, future experiments should aim to maintain this generalization capability while improving other metrics such as overall accuracy and loss.\n\n- **Automate Experimentation**: Consider automating the experimentation process to systematically explore a wider range of hyperparameters and configurations, potentially using techniques like Bayesian optimization or genetic algorithms.\n\nBy adhering to these recommendations and learning from both successful and failed experiments, future research can continue to advance the capabilities of zero-shot Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning models."
