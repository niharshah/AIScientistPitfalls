  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Effective Hyperparameter Tuning**: Successful experiments demonstrated the importance of hyperparameter tuning, such as varying the number of training epochs. This approach led to improved training and validation metrics, with perfect unseen rule accuracy (URA) across all configurations.\n\n- **Neural-Symbolic Hybrid Models**: The integration of neural networks with symbolic reasoning proved effective. By combining learned distributed representations with explicit symbolic statistics, these models achieved high shape-weighted accuracy (SWA) and demonstrated zero-shot generalization capabilities.\n\n- **Signature Gating Mechanism**: Experiments that employed a signature gating mechanism, where the model defers to symbolic rules for unseen signatures, showed strong performance. This approach allowed for perfect reasoning on unseen signatures while leveraging neural heuristics for known ones.\n\n- **Comprehensive Metric Tracking**: Successful experiments consistently tracked a range of metrics, including training loss, validation accuracy, and SWA, ensuring a thorough evaluation of model performance.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Incorrect Value Unpacking**: Several failed experiments encountered issues with incorrect unpacking of return values from functions, leading to errors such as `ValueError`. Ensuring proper handling of function outputs is crucial.\n\n- **Simplistic Model Architectures**: Experiments using overly simplistic models, like TinyPerceptron, struggled to capture complex patterns, resulting in poor performance on tasks requiring deeper reasoning.\n\n- **Ineffective Hybrid Logic**: Some experiments failed due to ineffective hybrid prediction logic, particularly in handling unseen signatures. This often led to low SWA and poor zero-shot reasoning capabilities.\n\n- **Data Handling Issues**: Errors in data handling, such as mismatched array shapes during evaluation, were common. Proper configuration of data loaders and careful handling of data across batches are essential.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Model Complexity**: Consider using more complex neural network architectures to better capture non-linear relationships and improve generalization, especially for tasks requiring deeper reasoning.\n\n- **Refine Hybrid Prediction Logic**: Re-evaluate and refine the hybrid prediction logic to ensure effective handling of unseen signatures. Consider testing alternative rule-based approaches and incorporating robust symbolic reasoning components.\n\n- **Ensure Proper Function Output Handling**: Pay close attention to the handling of function outputs to avoid errors related to incorrect value unpacking. This includes verifying the expected number of return values and their usage.\n\n- **Use Representative Datasets**: Whenever possible, use actual datasets rather than synthetic ones to ensure experiments are representative of real-world scenarios. This can help avoid issues related to data representativeness.\n\n- **Align Loss Functions with Desired Metrics**: Ensure that the loss function used during training aligns closely with the desired evaluation metrics, such as SWA, to avoid discrepancies between optimization and performance evaluation.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes and avoid the pitfalls observed in previous trials, leading to more robust and effective neural-symbolic models."
