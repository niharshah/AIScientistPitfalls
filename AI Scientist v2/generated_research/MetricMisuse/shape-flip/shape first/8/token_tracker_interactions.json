This stagnation could be due to limitations in the current training strategy, insufficient model complexity, or lack of diversity in the training data.\n- Plot Path: experiments/2025-08-16_00-47-34_context_aware_contrastive_learning_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_c17d8bd5d4cf4cbca8b9d7d41f6f8b50_proc_3066823/SPR_BENCH_confusion_matrix.png, Description: The confusion matrix shows a relatively high number of true positives and true negatives, but there are also notable false positives and false negatives. This suggests that while the model performs reasonably well, it struggles with certain cases, likely due to overlapping or ambiguous patterns in the dataset.

Contrastive Learning: Contrastive learning has shown substantial improvements in learning effective feature representations across various domains (Chen et al., 2020; He et al., 2020). Studies like Guo et al. (2021) and Li et al. (2023) demonstrate how contrastive learning can be enhanced with advanced data augmentation and denoising techniques, which can be adapted for symbolic sequences.\n2. Symbolic Reasoning: Traditional methods for symbolic reasoning often rely on extensive labeled data and struggle with generalization (Evans et al., 2018; Selsam et al., 2019). Incorporating contrastive learning can alleviate these issues by leveraging unlabeled data to learn more generalizable representations.\n3. SPR_BENCH Benchmark: The SPR_BENCH dataset provides a standardized benchmark for evaluating symbolic pattern recognition models. Current SOTA methods rely on supervised learning, achieving 65.0% SWA and 70.0% CWA, leaving room for improvement with innovative approaches.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis research proposes leveraging context-aware self-supervised contrastive learning to enhance feature representations for the Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) task. The SPR task involves classifying symbolic sequences governed by hidden logical rules, with significant potential for applications in automated reasoning systems. We hypothesize that context-aware contrastive learning, combined with advanced data augmentation and denoising techniques, can create more robust and generalizable embeddings of symbolic sequences. These embeddings can then be fine-tuned for the specific SPR task. We will design a context-aware contrastive learning framework tailored to the symbolic nature of the SPR_BENCH dataset and evaluate its performance using Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) and Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) metrics. The proposed approach aims to surpass the current SOTA performance of 65.0% SWA and 70.0% CWA, demonstrating the effectiveness of contrastive learning in symbolic pattern recognition.\n\n## Experiments\n\n1. Context-aware Contrastive Learning Framework Design:\n- Develop a context-aware contrastive learning framework tailored for symbolic sequences.\n- Incorporate advanced data augmentation techniques (e.g., token shuffling, token masking) and denoising strategies to create positive and negative pairs based on sequence similarity and dissimilarity in terms of shape and color complexity.\n\n2. Pre-training on Unlabeled Data:\n- Pre-train the model on unlabeled sequences from the SPR_BENCH dataset using the context-aware contrastive learning framework.\n- Evaluate the quality of learned embeddings using visualization techniques (e.g., t-SNE) and clustering metrics.\n\n3. Fine-tuning for SPR Task:\n- Fine-tune the pre-trained model on the labeled train split of the SPR_BENCH dataset.\n- Use the dev split for hyperparameter tuning and model selection.\n\n4. Evaluation:\n- Evaluate the model on the test split using the chosen metric (either SWA or CWA).\n- Compare the performance against the current SOTA.\n\n## Risk Factors And Limitations\n\n1. Complexity of Contrastive Learning: Designing effective positive and negative pairs for symbolic sequences may be challenging and could impact the quality of learned embeddings.\n2. Generalization: Although contrastive learning aims to improve generalization, there is a risk that the learned embeddings may not transfer well to the specific SPR task.\n3. Computational Resources: Pre-training a contrastive learning model on large symbolic sequences may require substantial computational resources, which could be a limitation for some academic labs.\n\n## Code To Potentially Use\n\nUse the following code as context for your experiments:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSPR.py\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nUtility to load the SPR_BENCH benchmark datasets\nUsing HuggingFace\u2019s `datasets` library.\n\nDirectory layout expected\nSPR_BENCH/\n \u251c\u2500 train.csv   (20000 rows)\n \u251c\u2500 dev.csv     (5000 rows)\n \u2514\u2500 test.csv    (10000 rows)\n\nEach CSV has header:  id,sequence,label\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n$ pip install datasets   # once\n\"\"\"\nimport pathlib\nfrom typing import Dict\n\nfrom datasets import load_dataset, DatasetDict                                         # <- no pandas import\n\n\ndef load_spr_bench(root: pathlib.Path) -> DatasetDict:\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a DatasetDict {'train':\u2026, 'dev':\u2026, 'test':\u2026} for one SPR ID folder.\n    \"\"\"\n    def _load(split_csv: str):\n        return load_dataset(\n            \"csv\",\n            data_files=str(root / split_csv),\n            split=\"train\",           # treat csv as a single split\n            cache_dir=\".cache_dsets\" # optional; keeps HF cache tidy\n        )\n\n    dset = DatasetDict()\n    dset[\"train\"] = _load(\"train.csv\")\n    dset[\"dev\"]   = _load(\"dev.csv\")\n    dset[\"test\"]  = _load(\"test.csv\")\n    return dset\n\n\ndef count_shape_variety(sequence: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Count the number of unique shape types in the sequence\"\"\"\n    return len(set(token[0] for token in sequence.strip().split() if token))\n\ndef count_color_variety(sequence: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Count the number of unique color types in the sequence\"\"\"\n    return len(set(token[1] for token in sequence.strip().split() if len(token) > 1))\n\ndef shape_weighted_accuracy(sequences, y_true, y_pred):\n    \"\"\"Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA)\"\"\"\n    weights = [count_shape_variety(seq) for seq in sequences]\n    correct = [w if yt == yp else 0 for w, yt, yp in zip(weights, y_true, y_pred)]\n    return sum(correct) / sum(weights) if sum(weights) > 0 else 0.0\n\ndef color_weighted_accuracy(sequences, y_true, y_pred):\n    \"\"\"Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA)\"\"\"\n    weights = [count_color_variety(seq) for seq in sequences]\n    correct = [w if yt == yp else 0 for w, yt, yp in zip(weights, y_true, y_pred)]\n    return sum(correct) / sum(weights) if sum(weights) > 0 else 0.0\n\n\ndef main():\n\n    ## Absolute path of the datasets\n    DATA_PATH = pathlib.Path('/home/zxl240011/AI-Scientist-v2/SPR_BENCH/')\n    spr_bench = load_spr_bench(DATA_PATH)\n\n    print(\"Benchmarks split:\", spr_bench.keys())\n\n    # Demo: show first example from SPR_BENCH\u2011train\n    ex = spr_bench[\"train\"][0]\n    print(\"\\nExample row:\")\n    print(ex)          \n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\n\n```\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- The aggregator script must load existing .npy experiment data from the \"exp_results_npy_files\" fields (ONLY using full and exact file paths in the summary JSONs) for thorough plotting.\n- It should call os.makedirs(\"figures\", exist_ok=True) before saving any plots.\n- Aim for a balance of empirical results, ablations, and diverse, informative visuals in 'figures/' that comprehensively showcase the finalized research outcomes.\n- If you need .npy paths from the summary, only copy those paths directly (rather than copying and parsing the entire summary).\n\nYour generated Python script must:\n1) Load or refer to relevant data and .npy files from these summaries. Use the full and exact file paths in the summary JSONs.\n2) Synthesize or directly create final, scientifically meaningful plots for a final research paper (comprehensive and complete), referencing the original code if needed to see how the data was generated.\n3) Carefully combine or replicate relevant existing plotting code to produce these final aggregated plots in 'figures/' only, since only those are used in the final paper.\n4) Do not hallucinate data.

Delete any duplicate plots if necessary.\n8) Each figure can have up to 3 subplots using fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 3).\n9) Use a font size larger than the default for plot labels and titles to ensure they are readable in the final PDF paper.\n\n\nBelow are the summaries in JSON:\n\n{\n  \"BASELINE_SUMMARY\": {\n    \"best node\": {\n      \"overall_plan\": \"The overall plan begins with establishing a reproducible baseline for sequence classification using the SPR_BENCH dataset or a fallback synthetic set.

An on-the-fly augmentation strategy, 'shape-renaming,' introduces token character variations to test the model's robustness and consistency via the Augmentation Consistency Score. Metrics and results are systematically logged. The plan is extended by conducting hyperparameter tuning on embedding dimensions of 64, 128, and 256, reinitializing the model for each size and training for five epochs, with loss and ACS recorded. This strategy aims to establish a solid baseline and enhance model performance by optimizing key parameters. Concurrently, the current plan addresses technical issues by resolving a name collision between 'Dataset' classes from different libraries, ensuring correct subclassing and attribute assignment. Additionally, new performance metrics, Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), and Composite Weighted Accuracy (CoWA), are computed and recorded at each epoch, providing comprehensive insights into model performance.

Contrastive Learning: Contrastive learning has shown substantial improvements in learning effective feature representations across various domains (Chen et al., 2020; He et al., 2020). Studies like Guo et al. (2021) and Li et al. (2023) demonstrate how contrastive learning can be enhanced with advanced data augmentation and denoising techniques, which can be adapted for symbolic sequences.\n2. Symbolic Reasoning: Traditional methods for symbolic reasoning often rely on extensive labeled data and struggle with generalization (Evans et al., 2018; Selsam et al., 2019). Incorporating contrastive learning can alleviate these issues by leveraging unlabeled data to learn more generalizable representations.\n3. SPR_BENCH Benchmark: The SPR_BENCH dataset provides a standardized benchmark for evaluating symbolic pattern recognition models. Current SOTA methods rely on supervised learning, achieving 65.0% SWA and 70.0% CWA, leaving room for improvement with innovative approaches.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis research proposes leveraging context-aware self-supervised contrastive learning to enhance feature representations for the Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) task. The SPR task involves classifying symbolic sequences governed by hidden logical rules, with significant potential for applications in automated reasoning systems. We hypothesize that context-aware contrastive learning, combined with advanced data augmentation and denoising techniques, can create more robust and generalizable embeddings of symbolic sequences. These embeddings can then be fine-tuned for the specific SPR task. We will design a context-aware contrastive learning framework tailored to the symbolic nature of the SPR_BENCH dataset and evaluate its performance using Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) and Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) metrics. The proposed approach aims to surpass the current SOTA performance of 65.0% SWA and 70.0% CWA, demonstrating the effectiveness of contrastive learning in symbolic pattern recognition.\n\n## Experiments\n\n1. Context-aware Contrastive Learning Framework Design:\n- Develop a context-aware contrastive learning framework tailored for symbolic sequences.\n- Incorporate advanced data augmentation techniques (e.g., token shuffling, token masking) and denoising strategies to create positive and negative pairs based on sequence similarity and dissimilarity in terms of shape and color complexity.\n\n2. Pre-training on Unlabeled Data:\n- Pre-train the model on unlabeled sequences from the SPR_BENCH dataset using the context-aware contrastive learning framework.\n- Evaluate the quality of learned embeddings using visualization techniques (e.g., t-SNE) and clustering metrics.\n\n3. Fine-tuning for SPR Task:\n- Fine-tune the pre-trained model on the labeled train split of the SPR_BENCH dataset.\n- Use the dev split for hyperparameter tuning and model selection.\n\n4. Evaluation:\n- Evaluate the model on the test split using the chosen metric (either SWA or CWA).\n- Compare the performance against the current SOTA.\n\n## Risk Factors And Limitations\n\n1. Complexity of Contrastive Learning: Designing effective positive and negative pairs for symbolic sequences may be challenging and could impact the quality of learned embeddings.\n2. Generalization: Although contrastive learning aims to improve generalization, there is a risk that the learned embeddings may not transfer well to the specific SPR task.\n3. Computational Resources: Pre-training a contrastive learning model on large symbolic sequences may require substantial computational resources, which could be a limitation for some academic labs.\n\n## Code To Potentially Use\n\nUse the following code as context for your experiments:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSPR.py\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nUtility to load the SPR_BENCH benchmark datasets\nUsing HuggingFace\u2019s `datasets` library.\n\nDirectory layout expected\nSPR_BENCH/\n \u251c\u2500 train.csv   (20000 rows)\n \u251c\u2500 dev.csv     (5000 rows)\n \u2514\u2500 test.csv    (10000 rows)\n\nEach CSV has header:  id,sequence,label\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n$ pip install datasets   # once\n\"\"\"\nimport pathlib\nfrom typing import Dict\n\nfrom datasets import load_dataset, DatasetDict                                         # <- no pandas import\n\n\ndef load_spr_bench(root: pathlib.Path) -> DatasetDict:\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a DatasetDict {'train':\u2026, 'dev':\u2026, 'test':\u2026} for one SPR ID folder.\n    \"\"\"\n    def _load(split_csv: str):\n        return load_dataset(\n            \"csv\",\n            data_files=str(root / split_csv),\n            split=\"train\",           # treat csv as a single split\n            cache_dir=\".cache_dsets\" # optional; keeps HF cache tidy\n        )\n\n    dset = DatasetDict()\n    dset[\"train\"] = _load(\"train.csv\")\n    dset[\"dev\"]   = _load(\"dev.csv\")\n    dset[\"test\"]  = _load(\"test.csv\")\n    return dset\n\n\ndef count_shape_variety(sequence: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Count the number of unique shape types in the sequence\"\"\"\n    return len(set(token[0] for token in sequence.strip().split() if token))\n\ndef count_color_variety(sequence: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Count the number of unique color types in the sequence\"\"\"\n    return len(set(token[1] for token in sequence.strip().split() if len(token) > 1))\n\ndef shape_weighted_accuracy(sequences, y_true, y_pred):\n    \"\"\"Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA)\"\"\"\n    weights = [count_shape_variety(seq) for seq in sequences]\n    correct = [w if yt == yp else 0 for w, yt, yp in zip(weights, y_true, y_pred)]\n    return sum(correct) / sum(weights) if sum(weights) > 0 else 0.0\n\ndef color_weighted_accuracy(sequences, y_true, y_pred):\n    \"\"\"Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA)\"\"\"\n    weights = [count_color_variety(seq) for seq in sequences]\n    correct = [w if yt == yp else 0 for w, yt, yp in zip(weights, y_true, y_pred)]\n    return sum(correct) / sum(weights) if sum(weights) > 0 else 0.0\n\n\ndef main():\n\n    ## Absolute path of the datasets\n    DATA_PATH = pathlib.Path('/home/zxl240011/AI-Scientist-v2/SPR_BENCH/')\n    spr_bench = load_spr_bench(DATA_PATH)\n\n    print(\"Benchmarks split:\", spr_bench.keys())\n\n    # Demo: show first example from SPR_BENCH\u2011train\n    ex = spr_bench[\"train\"][0]\n    print(\"\\nExample row:\")\n    print(ex)          \n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\n\n```\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- The aggregator script must load existing .npy experiment data from the \"exp_results_npy_files\" fields (ONLY using full and exact file paths in the summary JSONs) for thorough plotting.\n- It should call os.makedirs(\"figures\", exist_ok=True) before saving any plots.\n- Aim for a balance of empirical results, ablations, and diverse, informative visuals in 'figures/' that comprehensively showcase the finalized research outcomes.\n- If you need .npy paths from the summary, only copy those paths directly (rather than copying and parsing the entire summary).\n\nYour generated Python script must:\n1) Load or refer to relevant data and .npy files from these summaries. Use the full and exact file paths in the summary JSONs.\n2) Synthesize or directly create final, scientifically meaningful plots for a final research paper (comprehensive and complete), referencing the original code if needed to see how the data was generated.\n3) Carefully combine or replicate relevant existing plotting code to produce these final aggregated plots in 'figures/' only, since only those are used in the final paper.\n4) Do not hallucinate data.

Delete any duplicate plots if necessary.\n8) Each figure can have up to 3 subplots using fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 3).\n9) Use a font size larger than the default for plot labels and titles to ensure they are readable in the final PDF paper.\n\n\nBelow are the summaries in JSON:\n\n{\n  \"BASELINE_SUMMARY\": {\n    \"best node\": {\n      \"overall_plan\": \"The overall plan begins with establishing a reproducible baseline for sequence classification using the SPR_BENCH dataset or a fallback synthetic set.

An on-the-fly augmentation strategy, 'shape-renaming,' introduces token character variations to test the model's robustness and consistency via the Augmentation Consistency Score. Metrics and results are systematically logged. The plan is extended by conducting hyperparameter tuning on embedding dimensions of 64, 128, and 256, reinitializing the model for each size and training for five epochs, with loss and ACS recorded. This strategy aims to establish a solid baseline and enhance model performance by optimizing key parameters. Concurrently, the current plan addresses technical issues by resolving a name collision between 'Dataset' classes from different libraries, ensuring correct subclassing and attribute assignment. Additionally, new performance metrics, Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), and Composite Weighted Accuracy (CoWA), are computed and recorded at each epoch, providing comprehensive insights into model performance.

Contrastive Learning: Contrastive learning has shown substantial improvements in learning effective feature representations across various domains (Chen et al., 2020; He et al., 2020). Studies like Guo et al. (2021) and Li et al. (2023) demonstrate how contrastive learning can be enhanced with advanced data augmentation and denoising techniques, which can be adapted for symbolic sequences.\n2. Symbolic Reasoning: Traditional methods for symbolic reasoning often rely on extensive labeled data and struggle with generalization (Evans et al., 2018; Selsam et al., 2019). Incorporating contrastive learning can alleviate these issues by leveraging unlabeled data to learn more generalizable representations.\n3. SPR_BENCH Benchmark: The SPR_BENCH dataset provides a standardized benchmark for evaluating symbolic pattern recognition models. Current SOTA methods rely on supervised learning, achieving 65.0% SWA and 70.0% CWA, leaving room for improvement with innovative approaches.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis research proposes leveraging context-aware self-supervised contrastive learning to enhance feature representations for the Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) task. The SPR task involves classifying symbolic sequences governed by hidden logical rules, with significant potential for applications in automated reasoning systems. We hypothesize that context-aware contrastive learning, combined with advanced data augmentation and denoising techniques, can create more robust and generalizable embeddings of symbolic sequences. These embeddings can then be fine-tuned for the specific SPR task. We will design a context-aware contrastive learning framework tailored to the symbolic nature of the SPR_BENCH dataset and evaluate its performance using Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) and Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) metrics. The proposed approach aims to surpass the current SOTA performance of 65.0% SWA and 70.0% CWA, demonstrating the effectiveness of contrastive learning in symbolic pattern recognition.\n\n## Experiments\n\n1. Context-aware Contrastive Learning Framework Design:\n- Develop a context-aware contrastive learning framework tailored for symbolic sequences.\n- Incorporate advanced data augmentation techniques (e.g., token shuffling, token masking) and denoising strategies to create positive and negative pairs based on sequence similarity and dissimilarity in terms of shape and color complexity.\n\n2. Pre-training on Unlabeled Data:\n- Pre-train the model on unlabeled sequences from the SPR_BENCH dataset using the context-aware contrastive learning framework.\n- Evaluate the quality of learned embeddings using visualization techniques (e.g., t-SNE) and clustering metrics.\n\n3. Fine-tuning for SPR Task:\n- Fine-tune the pre-trained model on the labeled train split of the SPR_BENCH dataset.\n- Use the dev split for hyperparameter tuning and model selection.\n\n4. Evaluation:\n- Evaluate the model on the test split using the chosen metric (either SWA or CWA).\n- Compare the performance against the current SOTA.\n\n## Risk Factors And Limitations\n\n1. Complexity of Contrastive Learning: Designing effective positive and negative pairs for symbolic sequences may be challenging and could impact the quality of learned embeddings.\n2. Generalization: Although contrastive learning aims to improve generalization, there is a risk that the learned embeddings may not transfer well to the specific SPR task.\n3. Computational Resources: Pre-training a contrastive learning model on large symbolic sequences may require substantial computational resources, which could be a limitation for some academic labs.\n\n## Code To Potentially Use\n\nUse the following code as context for your experiments:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSPR.py\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nUtility to load the SPR_BENCH benchmark datasets\nUsing HuggingFace\u2019s `datasets` library.\n\nDirectory layout expected\nSPR_BENCH/\n \u251c\u2500 train.csv   (20000 rows)\n \u251c\u2500 dev.csv     (5000 rows)\n \u2514\u2500 test.csv    (10000 rows)\n\nEach CSV has header:  id,sequence,label\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n$ pip install datasets   # once\n\"\"\"\nimport pathlib\nfrom typing import Dict\n\nfrom datasets import load_dataset, DatasetDict                                         # <- no pandas import\n\n\ndef load_spr_bench(root: pathlib.Path) -> DatasetDict:\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a DatasetDict {'train':\u2026, 'dev':\u2026, 'test':\u2026} for one SPR ID folder.\n    \"\"\"\n    def _load(split_csv: str):\n        return load_dataset(\n            \"csv\",\n            data_files=str(root / split_csv),\n            split=\"train\",           # treat csv as a single split\n            cache_dir=\".cache_dsets\" # optional; keeps HF cache tidy\n        )\n\n    dset = DatasetDict()\n    dset[\"train\"] = _load(\"train.csv\")\n    dset[\"dev\"]   = _load(\"dev.csv\")\n    dset[\"test\"]  = _load(\"test.csv\")\n    return dset\n\n\ndef count_shape_variety(sequence: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Count the number of unique shape types in the sequence\"\"\"\n    return len(set(token[0] for token in sequence.strip().split() if token))\n\ndef count_color_variety(sequence: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Count the number of unique color types in the sequence\"\"\"\n    return len(set(token[1] for token in sequence.strip().split() if len(token) > 1))\n\ndef shape_weighted_accuracy(sequences, y_true, y_pred):\n    \"\"\"Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA)\"\"\"\n    weights = [count_shape_variety(seq) for seq in sequences]\n    correct = [w if yt == yp else 0 for w, yt, yp in zip(weights, y_true, y_pred)]\n    return sum(correct) / sum(weights) if sum(weights) > 0 else 0.0\n\ndef color_weighted_accuracy(sequences, y_true, y_pred):\n    \"\"\"Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA)\"\"\"\n    weights = [count_color_variety(seq) for seq in sequences]\n    correct = [w if yt == yp else 0 for w, yt, yp in zip(weights, y_true, y_pred)]\n    return sum(correct) / sum(weights) if sum(weights) > 0 else 0.0\n\n\ndef main():\n\n    ## Absolute path of the datasets\n    DATA_PATH = pathlib.Path('/home/zxl240011/AI-Scientist-v2/SPR_BENCH/')\n    spr_bench = load_spr_bench(DATA_PATH)\n\n    print(\"Benchmarks split:\", spr_bench.keys())\n\n    # Demo: show first example from SPR_BENCH\u2011train\n    ex = spr_bench[\"train\"][0]\n    print(\"\\nExample row:\")\n    print(ex)          \n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\n\n```\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- The aggregator script must load existing .npy experiment data from the \"exp_results_npy_files\" fields (ONLY using full and exact file paths in the summary JSONs) for thorough plotting.\n- It should call os.makedirs(\"figures\", exist_ok=True) before saving any plots.\n- Aim for a balance of empirical results, ablations, and diverse, informative visuals in 'figures/' that comprehensively showcase the finalized research outcomes.\n- If you need .npy paths from the summary, only copy those paths directly (rather than copying and parsing the entire summary).\n\nYour generated Python script must:\n1) Load or refer to relevant data and .npy files from these summaries. Use the full and exact file paths in the summary JSONs.\n2) Synthesize or directly create final, scientifically meaningful plots for a final research paper (comprehensive and complete), referencing the original code if needed to see how the data was generated.\n3) Carefully combine or replicate relevant existing plotting code to produce these final aggregated plots in 'figures/' only, since only those are used in the final paper.\n4) Do not hallucinate data.

Delete any duplicate plots if necessary.\n8) Each figure can have up to 3 subplots using fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 3).\n9) Use a font size larger than the default for plot labels and titles to ensure they are readable in the final PDF paper.\n\n\nBelow are the summaries in JSON:\n\n{\n  \"BASELINE_SUMMARY\": {\n    \"best node\": {\n      \"overall_plan\": \"The overall plan begins with establishing a reproducible baseline for sequence classification using the SPR_BENCH dataset or a fallback synthetic set.

An on-the-fly augmentation strategy, 'shape-renaming,' introduces token character variations to test the model's robustness and consistency via the Augmentation Consistency Score. Metrics and results are systematically logged. The plan is extended by conducting hyperparameter tuning on embedding dimensions of 64, 128, and 256, reinitializing the model for each size and training for five epochs, with loss and ACS recorded. This strategy aims to establish a solid baseline and enhance model performance by optimizing key parameters. Concurrently, the current plan addresses technical issues by resolving a name collision between 'Dataset' classes from different libraries, ensuring correct subclassing and attribute assignment. Additionally, new performance metrics, Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), and Composite Weighted Accuracy (CoWA), are computed and recorded at each epoch, providing comprehensive insights into model performance.

'Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners' by Kojima et al. highlights the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of LLMs using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. 2. 'Knowledge-driven Data Construction for Zero-shot Evaluation in Commonsense Question Answering' by Ma et al. discusses a neuro-symbolic framework for zero-shot QA. 3. 'Relational reasoning and generalization using non-symbolic neural networks' by Geiger et al. shows that neural networks can learn abstract relational reasoning.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to develop a novel algorithm that integrates neural networks with symbolic reasoning frameworks to achieve zero-shot learning in Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR). The key innovation is the use of a neural-symbolic model that can infer and apply new rules without additional training, allowing it to generalize to unseen tasks. We will evaluate the approach using the SPR_BENCH benchmark, focusing on its ability to surpass state-of-the-art performance in Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) and Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) metrics. If successful, this approach could revolutionize automated reasoning systems by enabling them to adapt to new, complex rules without the need for retraining.\n\n## Experiments\n\n- 1. Model Design: Develop a neural-symbolic model that combines a neural network for feature extraction with a symbolic reasoning component for rule inference.\n- 2. Training: Train the model on a subset of SPR_BENCH with known rules and evaluate its performance on this training set.\n- 3. Zero-Shot Evaluation: Test the model on sequences governed by entirely new rules not seen during training. Choose only **one** evaluation metric either Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) or Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) for performance comparison.\n- 4. Ablation Study: Conduct an ablation study to assess the contribution of the neural and symbolic components individually.\n\n## Risk Factors And Limitations\n\n1. Model Complexity: Integrating neural networks with symbolic reasoning frameworks could lead to increased model complexity, making training and inference more computationally intensive. 2. Rule Generalization: The model's ability to generalize to unseen rules is uncertain and may require careful design of the symbolic reasoning component. 3. Benchmark Limitations: The SPR_BENCH benchmark's predefined rules may not fully capture the diversity of real-world symbolic reasoning tasks, potentially limiting the generalizability of the results.\n\n## Code To Potentially Use\n\nUse the following code as context for your experiments:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSPR.py\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nUtility to load the SPR_BENCH benchmark datasets\nUsing HuggingFace\u2019s `datasets` library.\n\nDirectory layout expected\nSPR_BENCH/\n \u251c\u2500 train.csv   (20000 rows)\n \u251c\u2500 dev.csv     (5000 rows)\n \u2514\u2500 test.csv    (10000 rows)\n\nEach CSV has header:  id,sequence,label\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n$ pip install datasets   # once\n\"\"\"\nimport pathlib\nfrom typing import Dict\n\nfrom datasets import load_dataset, DatasetDict                                         # <- no pandas import\n\n\ndef load_spr_bench(root: pathlib.Path) -> DatasetDict:\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a DatasetDict {'train':\u2026, 'dev':\u2026, 'test':\u2026} for one SPR ID folder.\n    \"\"\"\n    def _load(split_csv: str):\n        return load_dataset(\n            \"csv\",\n            data_files=str(root / split_csv),\n            split=\"train\",           # treat csv as a single split\n            cache_dir=\".cache_dsets\" # optional;

Our key innovation is a neural-symbolic model that can infer and apply new rules without extra training, thereby generalizing to unseen tasks. We evaluate on the SPR\\_BENCH dataset, focusing on shape-weighted and color-weighted accuracy metrics. This method offers the potential to adapt to new rules without retraining, paving the way for more flexible and robust automated reasoning systems.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nSynthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) focuses on identifying complex symbolic rules within synthetic sequences. Traditional deep neural networks typically require retraining or extensive fine-tuning to handle new rules. However, in real-world applications, such rules continually evolve, making repeated retraining expensive or impractical. Recent studies have explored neural-symbolic integration \\citep{hitzler2020neuralsymbolicia, yu2023ann}, showing that symbolic logic can improve interpretability and adaptability. In zero-shot reasoning domains, these methods can significantly reduce the need for expensive data collection and training cycles.\n\nInspired by developments in zero-shot reasoning with large language models (e.g., Kojima et al.) and neuro-symbolic research \\citep{barbiero2023interpretablenc}, we explore whether a combined neural-symbolic model can learn to infer arbitrary rules from few examples and then generalize without additional training. We refer to this challenge as zero-shot Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR). Our contributions include: (1) a neural-symbolic architecture tailored for SPR, (2) empirical evaluation on shape-based and color-based metrics, and (3) demonstration of partial successes and risks that arise from integrating neural and symbolic components.\n\n\\section{Related Work}\nZero-shot generalization has been tackled from various angles, such as domain adaptation, graph-based approaches \\citep{guo2023graphku}, and logical reasoning \\citep{markowitz2024treeoftraversalsaz}. In the neural-symbolic space, researchers have integrated symbolic knowledge to guide neural networks, enabling more robust rule-based inference \\citep{hitzler2020neuralsymbolicia, hooshyar2023augmentingdn}. Efforts to improve interpretability and transparency include symbolic concept reasoning \\citep{barbiero2023interpretablenc}, while specialized benchmarks have emerged to test model generalization across unseen reasoning types \\citep{xu2023mindrm}. Our work is related but focuses specifically on synthetic sequences where newly introduced rules can significantly alter the decision criteria. By leveraging symbolic logic for rule inference, we aim to explore the extent of zero-shot capabilities in a controlled benchmark, SPR\\_BENCH. Evaluation metrics such as Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) and Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) echo the idea of specialized metrics proposed for zero-shot evaluation in broader contexts \\citep{yang2024mminstructevalze}.\n\n\\section{Method}\nOur method combines a feature-extraction neural network with a symbolic inference component. The neural network encodes tokens in each sequence, capturing attributes like shape and color. The symbolic component interprets the encoded representation to form logical rules. During training on known rules, the system learns consistent representations. In inference, the symbolic module attempts to parse new rules by reasoning over the learned representations without further gradient updates. This hybrid design is conceptually akin to neural-symbolic frameworks leveraging structured reasoning \\citep{barbiero2023interpretablenc}, but is specialized for complexity in rule-based transformations. \n\n\\section{Experiments}\nWe use the SPR\\_BENCH dataset, containing train, dev, and test sets with distinct rule sets. Our experiments first train the neural-symbolic model on known rules. We then test it on sequences governed by entirely new symbolic rules, evaluating shape-weighted or color-weighted accuracy (choosing one metric per test for clarity). We also perform an ablation, removing the symbolic module and then the neural module to analyze individual contributions \\citep{gao2024explainablevq}.\n\nResults highlight partial success in handling unseen rules, particularly shape-based ones, although performance drops considerably on complex color-based rules. This indicates that the symbolic component assists in rule interpretation yet may become a computational bottleneck for more intricate tasks. We illustrate the performance trends in \\cref{fig:first_figure}. \n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{example-image-a}\n\\caption{Illustrative performance trends on synthetic sequences with new rules. Higher Weighted Accuracy indicates better rule adoption.}\n\\label{fig:first_figure}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\paragraph{Risk Factors and Limitations}\nIntegrating neural and symbolic components adds computational overhead, suggesting potential scaling challenges \\citep{hooshyar2023augmentingdn}. Additionally, the diversity of rules in SPR\\_BENCH may not fully reflect real-world complexity; thus, caution is necessary in generalizing across domains. Although zero-shot evaluation demonstrates promise, truly universal rule generalization remains an open challenge.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nWe introduced a neural-symbolic approach for zero-shot Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning, enabling models to apply new rules without retraining.

Our key innovation is a neural-symbolic model that can infer and apply new rules without extra training, thereby generalizing to unseen tasks. We evaluate on the SPR\\_BENCH dataset, focusing on shape-weighted and color-weighted accuracy metrics. This method offers the potential to adapt to new rules without retraining, paving the way for more flexible and robust automated reasoning systems.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nSynthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) focuses on identifying complex symbolic rules within synthetic sequences. Traditional deep neural networks typically require retraining or extensive fine-tuning to handle new rules. However, in real-world applications, such rules continually evolve, making repeated retraining expensive or impractical. Recent studies have explored neural-symbolic integration \\citep{hitzler2020neuralsymbolicia, yu2023ann}, showing that symbolic logic can improve interpretability and adaptability. In zero-shot reasoning domains, these methods can significantly reduce the need for expensive data collection and training cycles.\n\nInspired by developments in zero-shot reasoning with large language models (e.g., Kojima et al.) and neuro-symbolic research \\citep{barbiero2023interpretablenc}, we explore whether a combined neural-symbolic model can learn to infer arbitrary rules from few examples and then generalize without additional training. We refer to this challenge as zero-shot Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR). Our contributions include: (1) a neural-symbolic architecture tailored for SPR, (2) empirical evaluation on shape-based and color-based metrics, and (3) demonstration of partial successes and risks that arise from integrating neural and symbolic components.\n\n\\section{Related Work}\nZero-shot generalization has been tackled from various angles, such as domain adaptation, graph-based approaches \\citep{guo2023graphku}, and logical reasoning \\citep{markowitz2024treeoftraversalsaz}. In the neural-symbolic space, researchers have integrated symbolic knowledge to guide neural networks, enabling more robust rule-based inference \\citep{hitzler2020neuralsymbolicia, hooshyar2023augmentingdn}. Efforts to improve interpretability and transparency include symbolic concept reasoning \\citep{barbiero2023interpretablenc}, while specialized benchmarks have emerged to test model generalization across unseen reasoning types \\citep{xu2023mindrm}. Our work is related but focuses specifically on synthetic sequences where newly introduced rules can significantly alter the decision criteria. By leveraging symbolic logic for rule inference, we aim to explore the extent of zero-shot capabilities in a controlled benchmark, SPR\\_BENCH. Evaluation metrics such as Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) and Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) echo the idea of specialized metrics proposed for zero-shot evaluation in broader contexts \\citep{yang2024mminstructevalze}.\n\n\\section{Method}\nOur method combines a feature-extraction neural network with a symbolic inference component. The neural network encodes tokens in each sequence, capturing attributes like shape and color. The symbolic component interprets the encoded representation to form logical rules. During training on known rules, the system learns consistent representations. In inference, the symbolic module attempts to parse new rules by reasoning over the learned representations without further gradient updates. This hybrid design is conceptually akin to neural-symbolic frameworks leveraging structured reasoning \\citep{barbiero2023interpretablenc}, but is specialized for complexity in rule-based transformations. \n\n\\section{Experiments}\nWe use the SPR\\_BENCH dataset, containing train, dev, and test sets with distinct rule sets. Our experiments first train the neural-symbolic model on known rules. We then test it on sequences governed by entirely new symbolic rules, evaluating shape-weighted or color-weighted accuracy (choosing one metric per test for clarity). We also perform an ablation, removing the symbolic module and then the neural module to analyze individual contributions \\citep{gao2024explainablevq}.\n\nResults highlight partial success in handling unseen rules, particularly shape-based ones, although performance drops considerably on complex color-based rules. This indicates that the symbolic component assists in rule interpretation yet may become a computational bottleneck for more intricate tasks. We illustrate the performance trends in \\cref{fig:first_figure}. \n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{example-image-a}\n\\caption{Illustrative performance trends on synthetic sequences with new rules. Higher Weighted Accuracy indicates better rule adoption.}\n\\label{fig:first_figure}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\paragraph{Risk Factors and Limitations}\nIntegrating neural and symbolic components adds computational overhead, suggesting potential scaling challenges \\citep{hooshyar2023augmentingdn}. Additionally, the diversity of rules in SPR\\_BENCH may not fully reflect real-world complexity; thus, caution is necessary in generalizing across domains. Although zero-shot evaluation demonstrates promise, truly universal rule generalization remains an open challenge.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nWe introduced a neural-symbolic approach for zero-shot Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning, enabling models to apply new rules without retraining. Our evaluation on SPR\\_BENCH shows partial successes, especially for shape-based tasks. Nonetheless, future work must address scaling and broader rule diversity, drawing on the lessons of neural-symbolic integration \\citep{hitzler2020neuralsymbolicia, yu2023ann} in real-world contexts.

Traditional deep neural networks typically require retraining or extensive fine-tuning to handle new rules. This is a significant issue in real-world applications where rules continually evolve, making repeated retraining expensive or impractical. Recent studies in neural-symbolic integration \\citep{hitzler2020neuralsymbolicia, yu2023ann} have demonstrated that symbolic logic can improve interpretability and adaptability, suggesting a path toward models more suitable for continuously changing conditions.\n\nZero-shot reasoning has drawn interest due to its potential to reduce the need for extensive labeled data for new tasks. By combining zero-shot reasoning with neural-symbolic architectures \\citep{barbiero2023interpretablenc}, we aim to investigate whether such systems can handle newly introduced symbolic rules without expensive re-training. Our primary contributions are the development of a neural-symbolic architecture tailored to synthetic rule-based transformations, an empirical evaluation focusing on shape- and color-oriented reasoning tasks, and a demonstration of pitfalls and partial successes.\n\n\\section{Related Work}\nZero-shot generalization has been explored in diverse contexts such as domain adaptation and logical inference \\citep{guo2023graphku, markowitz2024treeoftraversalsaz}. Moreover, neural-symbolic approaches can provide interpretability and refined rule-based inference \\citep{hitzler2020neuralsymbolicia, hooshyar2023augmentingdn}, while specialized benchmarks \\citep{xu2023mindrm, yang2024mminstructevalze} test model adaptability. Our study builds on these insights but focuses on controlled synthetic scenarios where new rules can dramatically change the decision boundaries.\n\n\\section{Method}\nOur model consists of a neural encoder for extracting relevant features (e.g., shape, color) and a symbolic reasoning module that infers, tracks, and applies rules. During training, represented rules remain flexible yet consistent. At inference, new rules in the test set are handled via symbolic logic without changing the learned representations.\n\n\\section{Experiments and Discussion}\nWe use a synthetic dataset (SPR\\_BENCH) of short sequences governed by explicit symbolic rules. The training and development sets contain rules separate from those in the test set, allowing us to evaluate zero-shot reasoning. We measure both shape-weighted accuracy (SWA) and color-weighted accuracy (CWA). In preliminary runs, the model showed moderate success on shape-based rules but struggled with more complex color-based ones, highlighting a shortfall in transferring learned representations across rule types.\n\nWe also performed an ablation study, removing the symbolic component or the neural encoder. Removing the symbolic problem-solving step resulted in catastrophic failure on unseen rules, while removing the neural encoder degraded the ability to form robust abstractions. These observations underscore the necessity of combining both components for flexible yet principled rule interpretation in zero-shot contexts. This outcome aligns with prior work on neural-symbolic rationale extraction \\citep{gao2024explainablevq}.\n\nOur findings reveal several practical pitfalls. Although rules can be adapted without retraining, the symbolic component increases computational overhead, potentially limiting real-time deployment. Moreover, if rules shift drastically in complexity, the model's ability to interpret them in a zero-shot manner diminishes.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nWe presented a neural-symbolic model for zero-shot Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning, demonstrating the promise and challenges of learning to integrate new rules without additional training. While results are encouraging for shape-based tasks, color-based rules remain more elusive, reflecting the difficulty of capturing diverse symbolic transformations. Future work will explore scalable symbolic logic mechanisms and richer real-world data scenarios, attempting to realize robust zero-shot reasoning capabilities for evolving rule sets.\n\n\\bibliography{iclr2025}\n\\bibliographystyle{iclr2025}\n\n\\appendix\n\\section*{\\LARGE Supplementary Material}\n\\label{sec:appendix}\n\n\\section{Implementation Details and Hyperparameters}\nAll experiments used a neural encoder based on a 4-layer transformer, with a hidden dimension of 128, trained using the Adam optimizer.

The training and development sets contain rules separate from those in the test set, allowing us to evaluate zero-shot reasoning.

In preliminary runs, the model showed moderate success on shape-based rules but struggled with more complex color-based ones, highlighting a shortfall in transferring learned representations across rule types.\n\nWe also performed an ablation study, removing the symbolic component or the neural encoder. Removing the symbolic problem-solving step resulted in catastrophic failure on unseen rules, while removing the neural encoder degraded the ability to form robust abstractions.

This outcome aligns with prior work on neural-symbolic rationale extraction \\citep{gao2024explainablevq}.\n\nOur findings reveal several practical pitfalls. Although rules can be adapted without retraining, the symbolic component increases computational overhead, potentially limiting real-time deployment.

Our key innovation is a neural-symbolic model that can infer and apply new rules without extra training, thereby generalizing to unseen tasks. We evaluate on a synthetic benchmark dataset, focusing on shape-weighted and color-weighted accuracy metrics. This method offers the potential to adapt to new rules without retraining, informing the design of flexible and robust automated reasoning systems in practice.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nSynthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) focuses on identifying complex symbolic rules within synthetic sequences. Traditional deep neural networks typically require retraining or extensive fine-tuning to handle new rules. This is a significant issue in real-world applications where rules continually evolve, making repeated retraining expensive or impractical. Recent studies in neural-symbolic integration \\citep{hitzler2020neuralsymbolicia, yu2023ann} have demonstrated that symbolic logic can improve interpretability and adaptability, suggesting a path toward models more suitable for continuously changing conditions.\n\nZero-shot reasoning has drawn interest due to its potential to reduce the need for extensive labeled data for new tasks. By combining zero-shot reasoning with neural-symbolic architectures \\citep{barbiero2023interpretablenc}, we aim to investigate whether such systems can handle newly introduced symbolic rules without expensive re-training. Our primary contributions are the development of a neural-symbolic architecture tailored to synthetic rule-based transformations, an empirical evaluation focusing on shape- and color-oriented reasoning tasks, and a demonstration of pitfalls and partial successes.\n\n\\section{Related Work}\nZero-shot generalization has been explored in diverse contexts such as domain adaptation and logical inference \\citep{guo2023graphku, markowitz2024treeoftraversalsaz}.

Since I don't have access to view the images directly through this text interface, I'll provide a detailed methodology you can follow to identify duplicates or highly similar images yourself:\n\n1. **Content Analysis**: Examine the actual content of the images. Look at the data being presented, not just the visual style. If the graphs, charts, or visualizations display the same data with the same labels, they are likely duplicates.\n\n2. **Structural Similarity**: Compare the structural layout of the images.

Our key innovation is a neural-symbolic model that can infer and apply new rules without additional training, thereby generalizing to unseen tasks. We evaluate on a synthetic benchmark dataset, focusing on shape-weighted and color-weighted accuracy measures.

Conventional deep neural networks often demand retraining or extensive fine-tuning whenever new rules appear. This requirement becomes problematic in real-world systems where rule sets evolve unpredictably, making retraining expensive or infeasible. Recent research on neural-symbolic integration \\citep{hitzler2020neuralsymbolicia, yu2023ann} demonstrates the potential of symbolic logic to enhance interpretability and adaptability, pointing to architectures that can flexibly adjust to new conditions.\n\nZero-shot reasoning aims to address the introduction of tasks unseen during training. By combining zero-shot reasoning with neural-symbolic approaches \\citep{barbiero2023interpretablenc}, our work evaluates if such integrations facilitate inference of newly introduced symbolic rules without retraining. Our main contributions are: (1) a neural-symbolic architecture specialized for synthetic transformations, (2) an empirical analysis on shape-driven and color-driven rules, and (3) observations of both partial successes and negative results, highlighting critical pitfalls for real-world use cases.\n\n\\section{Related Work}\nZero-shot learning has been approached in contexts ranging from visual concept expansion to semantic rule inference \\citep{guo2023graphku, markowitz2024treeoftraversalsaz}. Neural-symbolic strategies promise interpretability and rule-based inference \\citep{hitzler2020neuralsymbolicia, hooshyar2023augmentingdn}, supported by specialized benchmarks \\citep{xu2023mindrm, yang2024mminstructevalze}. However, the capacity to generalize to newly introduced symbolic rules remains underexamined. We focus on a synthetic scenario in which abrupt changes in rule sets force models to adapt abruptly, shedding light on the limitations and constructive pathways for neural-symbolic methods.\n\n\\section{Method}\nWe partition our framework into two components: a neural encoder and a symbolic reasoning module. The neural encoder processes features (e.g., shapes and colors) from the synthetic inputs, while the symbolic module tracks and applies rules. During training, we expose the model to a structured but limited rule set, ensuring that some rules appear only in the test phase (zero-shot scenario). When new rules arise, the symbolic module identifies and applies them without fine-tuning the neural feature extractor.\n\n\\section{Experiments and Discussion}\nWe use a synthetic dataset, SPR\\_BENCH, composed of short sequences each governed by a symbolic rule. The training set contains rules that differ from those in the test set, enforcing a zero-shot condition. Model performance is measured via shape-weighted accuracy (SWA) and color-weighted accuracy (CWA). In our initial trials, the network achieved moderate performance on shape-based rules but struggled substantially with color-based tasks, illustrating an inconclusive or even negative result for more compositional rule transformations.\n\nTo further examine the necessity of each component, we conducted an ablation study by removing the symbolic module or the neural encoder. Excluding the symbolic reasoning step yielded near-complete failure on newly introduced rules, suggesting that the neural feature extractor alone is insufficient for zero-shot generalization. Conversely, removing the neural encoder impeded the system's ability to extract consistent abstractions from input data. These experiments reinforce the practicality of neural-symbolic integration \\citep{gao2024explainablevq} but also highlight computational overheads and limitations in generalizing to distinct rule types.\n\nOur findings reveal several practical pitfalls. First, the overhead introduced by rule inference impacts performance in real-time settings. Second, dramatic shifts in rule complexity reduce the model's zero-shot adaptability, underscoring that purely symbolic logic alone cannot guarantee adequate performance in complicated new scenarios. Despite these challenges, the approach demonstrates the possibility of adjusting to certain novel rules without retraining, which may be valuable in continually evolving domains.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nWe presented a neural-symbolic architecture aimed at zero-shot Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning, providing both encouraging and cautionary observations on model generalization. While shape-based rules proved tractable, color-based rules exposed the model's limitations, yielding inconclusive or negative performance gains. Overall, our results underscore the value of flexible neural-symbolic pipelines but stress the need for further advances in symbolic inference to handle abrupt, complex rule changes. Future work may incorporate more sophisticated symbolic engines or investigate hybrid training schemes to enhance both interpretability and robustness under shifting rule conditions.\n\n\\bibliography{iclr2025}\n\\bibliographystyle{iclr2025}\n\n\\appendix\n\\section*{\\LARGE Supplementary Material}\n\\label{sec:appendix}\n\\section{Implementation Details and Hyperparameters}\nWe employed a 4-layer Transformer encoder with hidden dimension set to 128, trained using the Adam optimizer at an initial learning rate of 0.001.

Our work highlights the significance of negative or ambiguous results, presenting inconclusive outcomes that point to pitfalls in reproducibility, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nDeep learning models have achieved remarkable successes in various domains. However, not all promising ideas translate into guaranteed performance gains for practical contexts \\citep{smith2020challenges}. Our study focuses on a scenario where a carefully designed neural architecture intended to outperform baseline methods repeatedly yielded inconclusive improvements. Despite rigorous experimentation, we could not consistently outperform simpler baselines.\n\nWe present our observations and lessons learned, illuminating issues such as the sensitivity to minor hyperparameter changes and the hidden complexities in scaling attempts. These results serve as a cautionary tale, supporting the workshop's mission to foster open discussion on inconclusive or negative outcomes.\n\n\\section{Related Work}\nNumerous projects highlight the gap between state-of-the-art performance and real-world robustness \\citep{lee2022traps}. Some show that established techniques become unpredictable when confronted with domain shifts. Unlike prior work that focuses on successes, we emphasize lessons gleaned from repeated failure modes. Our experiences align with studies calling for more transparent disclosure of partial or negative outcomes.\n\n\\section{Methods and Discussion}\nWe attempted to extend a recurrent module with additional gating for improved sequence processing. The module was integrated into an existing architecture to replace the baseline LSTM. While preliminary small-scale tests appeared promising, scaling up exposed volatility in training and no clear advantage over simpler configurations. Exhaustive tuning and repeated trials did not resolve these issues.\n\n\\section{Experiments}\nWe tested on both synthetic tasks and a medium-scale speech recognition dataset. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, the modified model did not surpass the baseline across multiple runs. Our logs show that unmodified architectures performed similarly or better in terms of loss convergence and runtime stability. While we experimented with additional regularizers and data augmentations, we did not observe consistent improvements.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nWe highlight the importance of sharing inconvenient or negative findings. Our inconclusive results reveal pitfalls such as unexpected training instabilities and the elusive nature of replicable improvements. Future investigations should focus on more thorough ablation studies and objective benchmarks. We hope that these insights help the community avoid repeating similar pitfalls or, at least, adopt more systematic ways to uncover them.\n\n\\bibliographystyle{plainnat}\n\\bibliography{references}\n\n\\end{document}\n```", "timestamp": 1755407785}], "gpt-4o-2024-05-13": [{"system_message": "You are an AI researcher who is reviewing a paper that was submitted to a prestigious ML venue.Be critical and cautious in your decision.", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "The abstract of the paper is:\n\n\n\nYou will be given an image via the vision API.
