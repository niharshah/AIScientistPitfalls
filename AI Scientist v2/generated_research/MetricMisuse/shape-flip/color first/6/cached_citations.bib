% This paper provides a comprehensive survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), highlighting their applicability across various domains and focusing on addressing challenges in real-world scenarios such as imbalance, noise, privacy, and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. It is relevant to the theoretical foundation of GNNs and their capacity to model relational and structural data, supporting the choice of GNNs for the Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) task. This citation will be used in the Related Work section to justify the use of GNNs for capturing structural dependencies and relationships in symbolic sequences.

% This paper introduces Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCNs), designed to handle multi-relational data in knowledge graphs. This citation is essential for describing the methodology used in the proposed model for the SPR task, as it leverages R-GCNs to capture relational and structural information. It will be cited in the methodology section to justify the use of R-GCNs for edge representation and relational learning.

% The paper 'Class-Weighted Evaluation Metrics for Imbalanced Data Classification' discusses class-weighted evaluation metrics, offering insights into how weighted metrics can be used to handle imbalanced datasets. This is directly relevant to the introduction of Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) and Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) metrics in the SPR task. It will be cited in the methodology section to justify the use of these weighted accuracy metrics for evaluating performance in tasks with multi-faceted relational data.
