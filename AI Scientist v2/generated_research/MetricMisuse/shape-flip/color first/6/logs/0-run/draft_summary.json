  "Experiment_description": "The experiments involved using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to process SPR sequences, where sequences are represented as graphs with nodes characterized by shape and color tokens. Various nodes experimented with different configurations and architectures of GNNs, primarily focusing on baseline establishment and preliminary testing of these models.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are important as they represent an initial step in using GNNs for sequence processing, a novel approach that could enhance understanding and performance in sequence-based tasks. The findings highlight the challenges of overfitting and class imbalance, providing a foundation for further research and refinement in model design and training approaches.",
  "Description": "The methods involved creating GNNs using PyTorch Geometric, with features derived from token shape and color. Models were trained using cross-entropy loss and evaluated with metrics like Complexity-Weighted Accuracy. Training involved representation of sequences as graphs, with nodes as tokens and edges connecting consecutive tokens. The experiments aimed to establish a baseline and assess the initial performance and generalization capabilities of these models.",

      "description": "The training loss shows a consistent decrease over epochs, indicating that the model is learning effectively from the training data. However, the validation loss initially decreases slightly but then increases steadily after a few epochs.",
      "analysis": "This plot indicates that the model is overfitting to the training data, as evidenced by the increase in validation loss after initial improvement."

      "description": "The validation complexity-weighted accuracy (CompWA) decreases consistently over the epochs, reaching its lowest point at epoch 4 before slightly recovering.",
      "analysis": "This plot suggests that the model's ability to generalize to complex patterns deteriorates over time, indicating potential overfitting or suboptimal training strategies."

      "description": "The confusion matrix for the test set shows the distribution of predictions across three classes.",
      "analysis": "The uneven distribution of correct and incorrect predictions suggests the model struggles with certain classes, indicating a need for improved feature representation or handling of class imbalances."
