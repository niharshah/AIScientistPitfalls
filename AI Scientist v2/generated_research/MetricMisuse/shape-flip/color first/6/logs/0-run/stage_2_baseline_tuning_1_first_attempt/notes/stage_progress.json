  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Baseline Model Design**: The initial design of treating each SPR sequence as a graph and using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with PyTorch Geometric proved to be a functional baseline. This setup allowed for effective data loading, evaluation, and visualization, which are crucial for iterative improvements.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic grid searches and sweeps over hyperparameters such as `num_epochs`, `learning_rate`, `weight_decay`, and `batch_size` were successfully executed. These experiments provided insights into how different hyperparameters affect model performance, particularly the Complexity-Weighted Accuracy (CompWA).\n\n- **Early Stopping**: The use of early stopping based on validation loss was effective in preventing overfitting and optimizing training duration, as seen in the `num_epochs` tuning experiment.\n\n- **Data Handling**: The scripts were robust enough to handle the absence of the real SPR_BENCH dataset by falling back on synthetic data, ensuring that the experiments could run end-to-end without interruption.\n\n- **Result Storage and Visualization**: Consistent storage of results in structured formats and the generation of plots for analysis were key in understanding the performance trends across different settings.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Dataset Availability**: The reliance on synthetic data due to the absence of the real SPR_BENCH dataset may not fully capture the complexities of real-world data, potentially limiting the generalizability of the results.\n\n- **Learning Rate Sweep**: There was a lack of reported metrics for the learning rate sweep, indicating potential issues in execution or result logging for this particular hyperparameter.\n\n- **Limited Epochs in Some Sweeps**: Some hyperparameter sweeps, such as those for `weight_decay`, were limited to only 5 epochs, which might not be sufficient to fully explore the impact of these parameters on model performance.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Access to Real Data**: Ensure access to the real SPR_BENCH dataset to validate the findings from synthetic data experiments and improve the applicability of the results to real-world scenarios.\n\n- **Comprehensive Logging**: Improve logging mechanisms to ensure that all metrics are captured and reported, as seen with the missing metrics in the learning rate sweep.\n\n- **Extended Epochs for Sweeps**: Consider extending the number of epochs for hyperparameter sweeps to allow models to fully converge and provide more reliable insights into the effects of each parameter.\n\n- **Diverse Hyperparameter Exploration**: Continue exploring a wider range of hyperparameters and their combinations, potentially using automated hyperparameter optimization techniques to efficiently navigate the search space.\n\n- **Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation to ensure that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data, thereby increasing the robustness of the results.\n\n- **Advanced Model Architectures**: Explore more advanced GNN architectures or hybrid models that could capture more complex patterns in the data, potentially improving the CompWA metric further.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes achieved so far while mitigating the limitations observed in the current experimental setup."
