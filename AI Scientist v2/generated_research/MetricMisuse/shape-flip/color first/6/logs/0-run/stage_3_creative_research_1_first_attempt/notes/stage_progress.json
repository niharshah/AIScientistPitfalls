  "current_findings": "### Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Batch Size Tuning**: Experiments that involved tuning the batch size showed reasonable behavior in training and validation losses, as well as Complexity-Weighted Accuracy (CompWA). The batch size of 64 was found to be near-optimal in multiple experiments.\n\n- **Graph Neural Network (GNN) Architectures**: Utilizing graph-structured representations, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCNs), showed potential in capturing non-local regularities in SPR sequences. The introduction of relation-aware edges (e.g., sequential adjacency, same-color, and same-shape links) helped in reasoning over both local order and global equivalence classes.\n\n- **Data Handling Improvements**: Switching from random to rule-based synthetic data labels significantly improved model performance. This change provided a meaningful learning signal, leading to high accuracy metrics when the actual SPR_BENCH dataset was used.\n\n- **Device Management and Self-Contained Code**: Successful experiments ensured that the code was self-contained and adhered to GPU/CPU device management rules, allowing for seamless execution across different environments.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Reliance on Synthetic Data**: Experiments that relied on synthetic data instead of the actual SPR_BENCH dataset often resulted in suboptimal performance. The synthetic data might not capture the complexity of the real benchmark, leading to poor learning outcomes.\n\n- **Model Complexity and Training Issues**: Some experiments suffered from insufficient model complexity or inadequate training configurations, such as a limited number of epochs or inappropriate learning rates. This led to fluctuating validation losses and low accuracy metrics.\n\n- **Inadequate Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiments with fixed hyperparameters without exploration or tuning often failed to achieve optimal performance. This includes not experimenting with different learning rates, optimizers, or increasing model layers.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Utilize the Real Dataset**: Ensure the availability and correct loading of the SPR_BENCH dataset to provide a realistic training scenario. Avoid relying solely on synthetic data unless it is rule-based and closely mimics the real dataset.\n\n- **Enhance Model Complexity**: Consider increasing the complexity of the model by adding more layers, using more sophisticated architectures like R-GCNs, or increasing embedding dimensions. This can help capture more intricate patterns in the data.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Exploration**: Conduct thorough hyperparameter tuning, including experimenting with different batch sizes, learning rates, and optimizers. Consider implementing hyperparameter sweeps to identify the best configurations.\n\n- **Data Augmentation and Regularization**: Implement data augmentation techniques or regularization methods such as dropout to improve model generalization and prevent overfitting.\n\n- **Ablation Studies**: Perform ablation studies to identify which components of the model contribute most to performance. This can help in refining the model architecture and focusing on effective features.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations and learning from past successes and failures, future experiments can be better positioned to achieve state-of-the-art performance."
