        "Img_description": "The image consists of two empty subplots labeled (a) and (b). Neither subplot contains any data, axes labels, legends, or annotations.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is incomplete and lacks any data or visual elements to convey information. It is essential to populate the subplots with relevant data and ensure proper labeling of axes and inclusion of legends (if necessary) to make the figure meaningful.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption describes trends that cannot be observed in the figure because the subplots are empty. While the caption is concise, it is not supported by the figure. Once the figure is populated with data, the caption should be revised for accuracy.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references (Figure 1) discuss patterns related to batch size and performance, which are currently unobservable due to the figure's emptiness. The references are detailed, but the figure must be populated with meaningful data to align with these references."

    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The image consists of two side-by-side panels, intended to compare 'relational architecture' (left) and 'CplxWA' (right). However, the plots are blank, with no visible data, axes labels, legends, or annotations.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is incomplete or not rendered properly. It lacks essential information such as labeled axes, data points, or legends. Without these elements, it fails to convey any meaningful insights or comparisons. Improvements should include adding the missing data, labels, and annotations to align with the described topics.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption describes moderate improvements for relational architecture and better stability for CplxWA. However, without visible data in the figure, the claims cannot be validated. The caption is concise but lacks specificity about the metrics or expectations being discussed.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references describe Figure 2 as showing partial gains from integrating relational inductive biases and mention final performance improvements with variance under domain shifts. These references are unsubstantiated due to the missing content in the figure. The references need to be re-evaluated once the figure is complete and accurately reflects the described phenomena."
