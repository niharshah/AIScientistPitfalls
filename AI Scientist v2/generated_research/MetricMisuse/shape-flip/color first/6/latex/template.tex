\begin{abstract}
Real-world deep learning systems frequently exhibit unexpected failures, such as severe overfitting
and hidden brittleness to data shifts. This paper presents negative and partially successful
results from experiments aimed at improving model generalization across relational tasks. These
lessons highlight important pitfalls for practical deployment of sequence and graph-based deep
models in uncertain, ever-changing environments.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Deep learning research often reports high-profile successes, but crucial insights are also gleaned
from experiments that do not go as planned \citep{icbinb2025}. Failures such as unrecoverable
overfitting in large-batch training and inconsistent performance across complex tasks reflect real
challenges that practitioners face. This paper explores these pitfalls and partial improvements in
a relational learning context. Our contributions revolve around two major findings: first, how
batch-size scaling can induce overfitting and fragile test performance; second, how integrating
relational inductive biases yields moderate but significant improvements on complex tasks.

\section{Related Work}
Prior research has documented erratic behavior in large-batch training and potential overfitting
\citep{icbinb2025}. These concerns appear in both supervised \citep{icbinb2025} and
self-supervised contexts. Relational architectures, such as graph neural networks, have shown
promise for capturing structured dependencies \citep{icbinb2025}, yet partial failures remain
underexplored in the literature.

\section{Method / Problem Discussion}
We investigate a multi-task setup incorporating standard supervised objectives alongside
relational constraints. Our pipeline adapts a baseline deep model to work with a graph-based
relational module. The goal is to see if relational features mitigate the overfitting vulnerability
we detected in baseline experiments.

\section{Experiments}
All experiments were implemented in a controlled environment to isolate overfitting dynamics. The
baseline suffered from severe performance degradation with large batch sizes. The proposed
relational approach improved training stability, yet only partially bridged the gap between
training and validation metrics.

  sizes, (b) Corresponding Test CompWA performance often drops sharply beyond a moderate batch
  size.}
  \label{fig:baseline}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:baseline} reveals how large batches facilitate faster initial training but then
lead to sharply diminished results on unseen test data. The improved relational method, however,
remains somewhat robust to these issues.

  \caption{Relational architecture (left) shows moderate improvements in key metrics,
  while final CplxWA (right) indicates better stability across expectations.}
  \label{fig:relational}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:relational} highlights the partial gains of integrating relational inductive biases.
Although the final performance is improved, the model exhibits variance under domain shifts, which
suggests the need for further refinement.

\section{Conclusion}
We presented negative and partially successful results examining overfitting tied to batch-size
scaling and highlighting the incremental benefits of relational inductive biases. Our findings
underscore the importance of thorough empirical checks before deploying large-batch training or
complex relational architectures in production settings. Future work could investigate adaptive
regularization strategies that address these pitfalls and enhance reliability across varied data
distributions.
