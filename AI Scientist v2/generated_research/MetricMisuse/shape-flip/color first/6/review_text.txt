    "Summary": "The paper investigates the failure modes of deep learning systems in relational tasks, particularly focusing on overfitting caused by large batch sizes and the partial benefits of relational inductive biases. It reports negative and partially successful results to highlight pitfalls in practical deployment scenarios.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The focus on negative results and practical pitfalls is a valuable perspective that can benefit the community if executed rigorously.",
        "The topic of overfitting in large-batch training is relevant to the community."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper lacks significant technical contributions or novel insights. It primarily summarizes already known issues such as large-batch overfitting and the partial effectiveness of relational inductive biases.",
        "The experimental results are weak, showing limited improvements and failing to provide actionable conclusions.",
        "The writing is unclear, with vague descriptions, missing references (e.g., '[**?**]'), and insufficient details about the methodology and experiments.",
        "The claims are not well-supported by the presented evidence. There is no substantial analysis or theoretical explanation of the observed phenomena.",
        "The significance of the work is questionable as the findings are incremental and do not advance the state of the art."
