  "Experiment_description": "The experiments focused on converting SPR sequences into graph-based models using line graphs and graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Each node varied in its approach, from baseline models using undirected chain-graphs to more robust setups with line graphs, aiming to improve classification accuracy measured by complexity-weighted accuracy.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are vital as they represent initial attempts to leverage graph-based models for sequence classification, a task with significant implications in fields such as natural language processing and bioinformatics. The insights from these experiments establish a foundation for further refinement and innovation in model architecture and training strategies.",
  "Description": "The experiments involved converting symbolic SPR sequences to graph representations, embedding tokens, and processing them through GCNs. Training was conducted with a focus on GPU handling and complexity-weighted accuracy as a performance metric. Each setup aimed to improve generalization while addressing class imbalance and overfitting.",
