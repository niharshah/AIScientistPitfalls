    "Summary": "The paper investigates the performance of deeper Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Relational GCNs (R-GCNs), focusing on their tendency to overfit on synthetic datasets. It highlights the challenges of generalization in deeper GNNs and emphasizes the need for future work on regularization and architectural constraints.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper addresses an important and often overlooked problem: the generalization failures of deeper GNNs.",
        "The negative results and overfitting issues discussed are valuable contributions to the field, as they highlight the limitations of current GNN architectures.",
        "The authors advocate for greater transparency in reporting negative results, which is an important practice for the research community."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The experiments are conducted solely on synthetic datasets, which significantly limits the practical relevance of the findings.",
        "The methodology is not described in sufficient detail, making it difficult to evaluate the robustness of the experiments (e.g., hyperparameter settings, dataset statistics, etc.).",
        "The paper does not propose actionable solutions or concrete insights to address the identified issues, reducing its overall contribution.",
        "The writing is vague in several sections and lacks clarity, particularly in the discussion of experimental results.",
        "The conclusions are speculative and do not provide strong evidence or recommendations for practitioners."

    "Questions": [
        "Why were only synthetic datasets used? Can the authors provide justification for not including real-world datasets?",
        "What were the specific hyperparameters and experimental settings used (e.g., learning rate, regularization techniques, etc.)?",
        "Can the authors propose specific directions or preliminary solutions for mitigating overfitting in deeper GNNs?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not adequately address the limitations of using only synthetic datasets and does not discuss the potential negative societal impacts of the findings.",
        "The lack of actionable solutions or concrete recommendations significantly reduces the utility of the work."
