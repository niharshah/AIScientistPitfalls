% The paper 'DeepMCGCN: Multi-channel Deep Graph Neural Networks' discusses the use of GNNs to model multi-relational graph data, addressing challenges such as overfitting and oversmoothing in deeper GNNs. It is relevant to the methodology section of the paper, as it provides theoretical and empirical support for using GNNs to capture relational and structural dependencies in data, which is a central hypothesis of the proposed work on the SPR task.

% Paper 1 introduces benchmarks for systematic relational reasoning, requiring aggregation from multiple paths and demonstrating state-of-the-art results for tasks needing structured reasoning. This is relevant for discussing the evaluation benchmarks for SPR tasks and comparing GNN-based models. Paper 3 provides a benchmark for explainable AI in GNNs, which is useful for evaluating the interpretability of GNN-based models in structured reasoning tasks. These citations will be included in the evaluation and discussion sections of the paper.
