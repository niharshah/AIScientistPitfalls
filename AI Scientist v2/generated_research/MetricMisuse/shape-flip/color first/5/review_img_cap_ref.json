    "figure_1": {
        "Img_description": "The figure contains two subplots. Subplot (a) is labeled 'Training and validation loss,' and its file name is 'Baseline_Loss_Curves.png.' Subplot (b) is labeled 'Accuracy trends over epochs,' and its file name is 'Baseline_Accuracy_Curves.png.' No actual data curves, axes, or legends are visible, making it impossible to interpret or validate the trends described.",
        "Img_review": "The figure lacks essential data visualization elements, including curves, axes, labels, and legends, making it non-informative. To improve, actual data curves must be added along with appropriate axis labels, legends, and clear differentiation between training and validation metrics.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption claims that overfitting arises within the first 20 epochs, with validation loss diverging while training performance improves. While concise and providing a clear takeaway, the caption cannot be validated due to the absence of visual data in the figure.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure as demonstrating baseline GCN performance, early accuracy improvements, and later overfitting. However, the empty figure does not provide the necessary evidence to support these claims. The references align with the caption but are unsupported by the figure itself."
    },
    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The figure consists of two subplots with placeholders instead of graphical data. Subplot (a) is labeled 'SPR_RGCN_Loss_Curve.png,' suggesting it represents a training vs. validation loss curve. Subplot (b) is labeled 'SPR_RGCN_Test_Summary.png,' likely summarizing test metrics for SPR_RGCN. No actual plots or data are visible.",
        "Img_review": "The figure lacks actual graphical content, making it impossible to evaluate the trends or insights it is supposed to convey. Suggestions for improvement include replacing the placeholders with rendered plots, adding clear axis labels, including a legend, and highlighting key trends such as overfitting and performance comparisons.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption is concise and communicates the intended message (overfitting and lack of performance improvement in deeper R-GCNs). However, without corresponding data in the figure, the caption cannot be validated. It is appropriately short but requires visual evidence for support.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references Figure 2 adequately, explaining the trends it is expected to demonstrate. However, the absence of actual data in the figure prevents these references from being substantiated. The references would benefit from being paired with an informative and complete figure."
    },
    "figure_3": {
        "Img_description": "The image is a placeholder with the text 'MultiSyntheticGeneralization.png' and does not contain any graphical or data-driven content.",
        "Img_review": "The figure lacks any substantive content, such as axes, data points, or visualizations, to analyze scientifically. It fails to fulfill the purpose of illustrating 'performance across multiple synthetic expansions.' Replace the placeholder with an actual figure that provides meaningful insights.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption claims the figure shows 'Performance across multiple synthetic expansions.' This is misleading, as the image does not contain any data or visual content to support this claim. The caption needs to be revised once a meaningful figure is provided.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The references in the main text mention that the figure illustrates performance on synthetic expansions. However, the placeholder figure does not align with these references, making them incomplete or misaligned. Once the figure is updated, the text references should be revisited to ensure consistency and clarity."
    },
    "figure_4": {
        "Img_description": "The image is a textual placeholder ('SequentialEdge_Graph_Final.png') rather than a graphical figure. No visual elements are present for analysis.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is missing, so no assessment can be made regarding clarity, labeling, or alignment with the caption. It is crucial to include the actual figure in the paper for meaningful evaluation.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption ('Removing sequential edges') is concise and may be appropriate if the figure illustrates a process of sequential edge removal. However, without the figure, its alignment with the content cannot be determined.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The references to the figure in the main text are incomplete or missing ('[]'). This offers no insight into the figure's context, purpose, or relevance. The text should include a detailed discussion of the figure and its implications."
    },
    "figure_5": {
        "Img_description": "The image is a placeholder titled 'SPR_RGCN_MultiMetric_Curves.png,' with no actual figure content. It suggests that the intended figure should display performance curves for R-GCN across multiple metrics.",
        "Img_review": "There is no actual figure to analyze. The placeholder should be replaced with the actual figure to enable evaluation. Potential issues such as missing labels, unclear legends, or insufficient detail cannot be assessed.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption suggests that the figure should present detailed performance curves for R-GCN across multiple metrics. Without the actual figure, it cannot be determined if the caption is appropriate. The caption could include a concise takeaway once the figure is available.",
        "Figrefs_review": "No references to the figure are present in the main text ([]). This is a critical issue, as the figure is not contextualized or explained in the narrative. Proper references should be included to integrate the figure into the paper."
    },
    "figure_6": {
        "Img_description": "The figure appears to display results from experiments involving shallow Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with varying depths. However, it lacks axis labels, legends, and a title, making it difficult to interpret what is being measured or compared. Multiple lines or plots may represent different configurations or depths of GNNs, but this is unclear.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is poorly presented, with missing axis labels, legend, and title. These omissions make it impossible to understand the figure's content, trends, or conclusions. The visual quality and clarity must be improved to ensure the figure communicates meaningful insights. Additionally, the lack of context or explanation further reduces its usefulness.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption highlights that very shallow GNNs underfit, emphasizing the importance of depth. While concise, it does not explain what the figure illustrates or what the axes represent. The caption could be improved with a brief mention of the key trends or metrics shown in the figure, assuming these are clarified.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references for the figure are missing. This omission prevents readers from understanding how the figure is related to the broader discussion or conclusions. Proper integration and explanation in the main text are necessary to provide context and relevance."
