    "Summary": "The paper discusses pitfalls in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), focusing on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs), particularly their sensitivity to hyperparameters and misclassifications. It presents limited experiments on node classification to highlight these issues but fails to provide significant new insights or remedies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper addresses an important topic: understanding and mitigating the limitations of GNNs for real-world deployment."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper lacks originality, mostly reiterating well-known issues in GNNs without significant new findings or contributions.",
        "The experiments are limited in scope and poorly presented, with little rigor in the evaluation of claims.",
        "Clarity is a significant issue\u2014key details are vague, and critical references are missing (e.g., marked as [??]).",
        "The paper's findings are largely negative and fail to provide actionable insights or practical remedies for the highlighted issues.",
        "The conclusions are superficial and do not advance the state of the art in any meaningful way."

    "Questions": [
        "Can the authors clarify the experimental setup and provide more rigorous evaluation metrics to support their claims?",
        "What specific insights do the confusion matrices provide, and how do they advance the understanding of GNN behaviors?",
        "Are there any concrete remedies or techniques proposed in the paper, or is it purely observational?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not adequately address potential negative societal impacts, but this is less relevant given its focus on technical pitfalls.",
        "The lack of depth and rigor in the analysis limits its practical usefulness."
