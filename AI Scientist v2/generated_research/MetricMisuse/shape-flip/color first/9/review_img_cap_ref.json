    "figure_1": {
        "Img_description": "The figure consists of four subplots labeled (a), (b), (c), and (d). The placeholders indicate that the subfigures are meant to depict training vs. validation loss, harmonic mean, validation harmonic mean scores, and confusion matrix misclassifications. However, the actual data visualizations are missing.",
        "Img_review": "The figure lacks actual data visualizations, making it impossible to evaluate its quality or insights. There are no axis labels, legends, or annotations visible. To improve, the authors should include the actual plots with appropriate labels, legends, and concise annotations that highlight key trends or results.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption, 'Baseline GCN Results with varying hyperparameters,' is too generic and does not provide meaningful detail. A good caption should summarize the key findings or trends visible in the figure. Once the plots are included, the caption should be updated to reflect the insights presented in each subplot.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references provide a detailed explanation of what the figure is supposed to convey. However, without the actual visual content, it is impossible to confirm the alignment. With completed figures, the references should explicitly link insights or trends to the respective subfigures for clarity."
    },
    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The image contains only the text 'research_overview.png' and does not include any visual elements or data representation.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is missing. Without it, no assessment can be made regarding its content, clarity, or alignment with the caption and main text references. The authors should include the actual figure to enable evaluation.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption suggests that the figure demonstrates partial performance gains and confusion among specific classes in GAT results. However, without the actual figure, it is impossible to determine whether this claim is accurate. The caption appears concise and descriptive, but it must be reassessed once the figure is available.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references describe the intended content of Figure 2, mentioning learning curves and a confusion matrix. These references seem appropriate, but their adequacy cannot be fully judged without seeing the actual figure. The authors must ensure that the figure, when included, aligns with these references."
