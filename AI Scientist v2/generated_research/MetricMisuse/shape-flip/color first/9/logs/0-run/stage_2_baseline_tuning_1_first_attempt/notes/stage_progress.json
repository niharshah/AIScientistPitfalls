  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Baseline Model Design**: The initial baseline model effectively established a foundation by converting sequences into simple graphs and using a GCN with global-mean pooling. This approach consistently yielded reasonable metrics, demonstrating its robustness as a starting point.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiments with hyperparameter tuning, such as varying `num_epochs`, `batch_size`, and `weight_decay`, showed improvements in metrics like SDWA and loss. For instance, increasing the number of epochs generally improved SDWA and reduced loss, indicating that the model benefited from longer training.\n\n- **Feature Representation**: The transition from using raw integer IDs to one-hot vectors for shape and color significantly improved the model's performance. This change allowed the GCN to process categorical data more effectively, resulting in better training and validation metrics.\n\n- **Metric Tracking**: Consistent tracking of multiple metrics, including SDWA, CWA, SWA, and their harmonic mean, provided a comprehensive view of the model's performance. This approach allowed for more informed decision-making during hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Flat Metric Scores**: Several failed experiments, particularly those involving learning rate, hidden dimensions, and dropout rate tuning, resulted in flat SDWA scores across different settings. This suggests issues with the metric implementation, data generation, or model architecture.\n\n- **Synthetic Data Limitations**: The use of synthetic data often led to models that did not learn effectively, as evidenced by constant metric scores. This indicates that the synthetic dataset may not be challenging or representative enough for meaningful learning.\n\n- **Metric Misalignment**: Relying on ad-hoc metrics like SDWA without proper validation led to misleading results. The transition to official metrics (CWA, SWA, HM-Score) was necessary to obtain accurate assessments of model performance.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Data Quality and Diversity**: Consider using real datasets or enhancing synthetic data to ensure it is challenging and representative. This will help the model learn meaningful patterns and improve generalization.\n\n- **Metric Validation**: Ensure that all metrics are correctly implemented and validated. Use official metrics where possible and align them with the model's objectives to avoid misleading results.\n\n- **Model Architecture Exploration**: Experiment with different model architectures, such as adding more layers or trying different GNN variants, to identify configurations that better capture the complexity of the data.\n\n- **Custom Loss Functions**: Explore custom loss functions that directly optimize for desired metrics like SDWA or HM-Score. This can help align the training process with the evaluation criteria.\n\n- **Comprehensive Hyperparameter Sweeps**: Conduct thorough hyperparameter sweeps with a focus on understanding their impact on model performance. Use early stopping and patience to prevent overfitting and ensure efficient training.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes and avoid the pitfalls observed in the current experimental progress."
