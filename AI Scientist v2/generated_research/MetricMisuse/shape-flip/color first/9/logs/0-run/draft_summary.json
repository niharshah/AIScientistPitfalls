  "Experiment_description": "Experiments conducted involved processing symbol sequences into graph representations using two-layer GCNs. The models were evaluated using metrics like Structural-Diversity-Weighted Accuracy (SDWA) and Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), with a focus on establishing baseline performances.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are crucial as they establish baseline models for graph-based sequence processing, identifying key challenges such as overfitting and class imbalance. The insights gained pave the way for future improvements in model architecture and data handling to enhance generalization performance.",
  "Description": "The experiments involved converting symbol sequences into graph structures, using GCNs to process these graphs, and evaluating models with various accuracy metrics. The models were trained over multiple epochs, with careful tracking of training and validation losses. Some nodes addressed data handling bugs, while others focused on foundational model setups.",
