  "current_findings": "### Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Feature Representation**: Successful experiments consistently used one-hot encoding for categorical features like shape and color, combined with normalized positional features. This approach provided meaningful binary inputs to the GNN, allowing it to learn effectively.\n\n- **Graph Construction**: Enriching the graph structure by adding relations such as \"same-shape\" and \"same-color\" alongside sequential order significantly improved model performance. This allowed the models to propagate information along latent rule dimensions effectively.\n\n- **Model Architecture**: Transitioning from basic GCNs to more advanced architectures like multi-head Graph Attention Networks (GAT) and Relation-aware GCNs (R-GCN) helped in learning different weights for various edge categories, enhancing the model's ability to capture complex relationships.\n\n- **Training and Evaluation**: Monitoring key metrics such as CWA, SWA, and their harmonic mean (HWA) at every epoch, and using these to select the best-performing model, was a common practice in successful experiments. This ensured that the models were evaluated comprehensively.\n\n- **Resource Management**: Ensuring that the code is GPU-aware and can fall back to synthetic datasets when the real dataset is unavailable allowed experiments to run efficiently within time constraints.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Dataset Availability**: A recurring issue was the failure to load the real SPR_BENCH dataset due to missing modules or incorrect paths. This often led to reliance on synthetic data, which did not provide insights into actual benchmark performance.\n\n- **Class Index Mismatches**: Some experiments suffered from low validation accuracy due to mismatched class indices between training and evaluation splits. This was caused by not accounting for all possible labels across splits.\n\n- **Excessive Edge Construction**: Using permutations instead of combinations for edge construction led to an excessive number of graph edges, inflating memory and compute costs unnecessarily.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Ensure Dataset Accessibility**: Verify that all necessary modules and datasets are available and correctly configured in the environment. This includes ensuring the 'SPR' module is installed and the 'SPR_DATA' environment variable is set correctly.\n\n- **Comprehensive Label Mapping**: Implement a global label mapping across all data splits to prevent index mismatches and ensure the model can handle all classes during training and evaluation.\n\n- **Optimize Graph Construction**: Use combinations instead of permutations for constructing graph edges to reduce computational overhead and improve efficiency.\n\n- **Leverage Advanced Architectures**: Continue exploring advanced GNN architectures like R-GCN and GAT, which have shown promise in capturing complex relationships in the data.\n\n- **Robust Metric Tracking**: Maintain comprehensive tracking of all relevant metrics and ensure that these are used to guide model selection and evaluation.\n\nBy addressing these areas, future experiments can build on past successes while avoiding common pitfalls, ultimately leading to more robust and effective models."
