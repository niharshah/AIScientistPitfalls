        "Img_description": "The image is a placeholder with the text 'group1_per_epoch_curves.png' and does not contain any visual data or figure content.",
        "Img_review": "No actual figure content is present in the image. As such, no analysis of figure elements, axes, or data representation can be performed. Suggestions for improvement cannot be made without the actual figure.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption provides a concise description of what the figure is expected to convey: a comparison of training, validation, and cumulative weighted accuracy for baseline vs. GNN, with a focus on GNN's validation volatility and inconsistent improvements. It is well-written but cannot be fully evaluated for accuracy without the figure. If the figure accurately depicts the stated behaviors, the caption should be adequate.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references provide a clear explanation of the figure's purpose and expected content. The discussion of per-epoch curves and the performance differences between baseline and GNN aligns with the caption. However, without the figure, it is impossible to verify whether the references are sufficiently descriptive or if they align well with the actual visual representation."

    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The provided image is a placeholder with the text 'ablation_confusion_matrices.png'. It contains no visual representation of confusion matrices or any other data relevant to ablation studies.",
        "Img_review": "The image is not informative as it is a placeholder and lacks any graphical content. To improve, the actual confusion matrices should be included, with clear axis labels, titles, and legends. This would allow for proper analysis and alignment with the caption and references.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption describes confusion matrices for ablation studies and states a specific finding about the impact of removing batch normalization or positional embeddings. However, without the actual figure, this claim cannot be verified or critiqued. The caption is concise but relies entirely on the missing figure for substantiation.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references mention Figure 2 in the context of additional experimental details, confusion matrices, and hyperparameter specifications. However, the placeholder image does not provide any content to support these references. The references would be adequate if the actual figure were included, but as it stands, they lack meaningful integration with the placeholder."
