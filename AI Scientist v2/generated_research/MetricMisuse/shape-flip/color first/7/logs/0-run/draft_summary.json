  "Experiment_description": "The experiments involve transforming symbolic sequences into graph structures and employing GNNs using GCN and GraphSAGE architectures to classify the sequences, focusing on training loss, validation loss, and Complexity-Weighted Accuracy across epochs.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are important as they explore the initial capabilities and limitations of using GNNs for sequence data classification. The findings highlight challenges such as overfitting, class imbalance, and feature representation, which are critical for enhancing model generalization and accuracy.",
  "Description": "Each node transforms sequences into graphs and applies a GNN (either GCN or GraphSAGE) with global mean-pooling and a linear classifier. The models are trained using cross-entropy loss, and metrics like Complexity-Weighted Accuracy are tracked. Variations in performance across nodes provide insights into different modeling approaches and their generalization capabilities.",
