    "Summary": "The paper documents challenges in deploying GNNs on an industrial structured prediction task, showing that simpler baselines sometimes outperform GNNs. It identifies issues with hyperparameter tuning, overfitting, and data preprocessing as contributing factors to GNN underperformance. The authors argue that these findings can guide future deployments and reduce failures.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper touches on an important topic: the practical challenges and limitations of graph-based models in real-world tasks.",
        "Negative results are valuable for the community, and the authors document cases where GNNs underperform compared to simpler models.",
        "The work emphasizes the importance of understanding the interaction between model architectures and data preprocessing in industrial applications."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper is severely lacking in technical depth. It does not provide sufficient details about the GNN architecture, baseline models, or dataset, making it hard to evaluate the claims.",
        "The experiments are too limited in scope. The analysis is based on a single, private dataset, and no systematic ablation or broader testing is presented.",
        "The findings are largely anecdotal and do not generalize well. The authors fail to provide deep insights into why GNNs fail in this context, nor do they propose actionable solutions.",
        "There is no theoretical analysis or significant methodological contribution, making the work better suited for a workshop or practitioner forum rather than a top-tier ML conference.",
        "The related work section is underdeveloped and lacks proper citations. Many references are placeholders (e.g., '[??]').",
        "The clarity is poor, with incomplete descriptions of the methods and results. For example, Figure 1 and confusion matrices are referenced but not explained sufficiently."

    "Questions": [
        "What exact GNN architecture and hyperparameters were used in the experiments? Please provide details.",
        "Can you elaborate on why the GNN underperformed? Was it due to specific characteristics of the dataset or model design?",
        "What steps were taken to ensure fair comparison between the baseline and GNN? Were the baselines carefully tuned as well?",
        "How generalizable are these findings to other datasets and tasks? Did you test on any public benchmarks?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not sufficiently address the limitations of its findings, particularly the lack of generalizability due to reliance on a single private dataset.",
        "The potential societal impacts of documenting failures in GNN deployment are not discussed."
