\begin{abstract}
We investigate the robustness of graph neural networks in real-world scenarios with incomplete or noisy data. Our experiments reveal that performance gains on synthetic benchmarks often fail to translate to more challenging practical regimes. We highlight key pitfalls, discuss partial successes, and propose concrete takeaways to guide future investigations.

\section{Introduction}
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become state-of-the-art for numerous tasks including molecular property prediction and social network analysis \citep{gilmer2017neural,kipf2017semi,hamilton2017inductive}. However, substantial performance drops have been reported when these models are deployed on data that violate common assumptions (e.g., node or edge types omitted) \citep{hu2020open}. Our work illuminates these real-world challenges through overfitting analyses and domain discrepancy findings. We do not necessarily improve upon existing baselines but rather shed light on recurring pitfalls and partial mitigations.

\section{Related Work}
Several researchers have demonstrated that GNN performance may be overstated on curated datasets that do not reflect real-world imperfections \citep{shchur2018pitfalls,ying2018graph}. Others have proposed domain adaptation strategies specific to graph-structured data \citep{wu2020comprehensive}. Our study differs in focusing on how training dynamics and small data shifts amplify overfitting, even in otherwise benign benchmark settings.

\section{Method}
We use a standard graph convolutional baseline \citep{kipf2017semi} and an attentional variant as potential improvements. Both are evaluated across synthetic and real-world splits. We track metrics beyond accuracy, considering stability under data corruption and reduced feature sets.

\section{Experiments}
We summarize the main training curves to illustrate overfitting and the accuracy gap. Despite promising validation metrics, test errors fluctuate dramatically when data complexity increases or certain edges are removed. Figure~\ref{fig:main1} compares baseline versus variant performance for a representative synthetic dataset. Figure~\ref{fig:main2} shows real-world results with noticeable accuracy degradation.

\end{figure}

Accuracy gains on synthetic benchmarks do not consistently generalize, highlighting limited robustness. Further analysis pinpoints specific node classes whose misclassifications disproportionately degrade test metrics. Our logs indicate wide variance across different splits. Despite attempts at data augmentation, the improvements remain inconsistent.

\section{Conclusion}
We examined the gap between synthetic benchmark improvements and their real-world portability. Empirically, our results illustrate a widespread and underreported fragility in GNNs. We hope our findings encourage broader adoption of stress tests for practical deployment and spur research on robust graph methods.
