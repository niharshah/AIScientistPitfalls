    "figure_1": {
        "Img_description": "The figure consists of two subplots: (a) and (b). Both subplots contain placeholder text ('eval.png' in (a) and 'variant_synth.png' in (b)) instead of actual data visualizations. No axes, labels, legends, or meaningful content are present.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is incomplete and lacks data visualization. It does not provide any information about overfitting trends or performance comparisons as claimed. Improvements needed include replacing placeholder text with actual plots, adding axes, labels, legends, and ensuring the content aligns with the intended analysis.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption, 'Overfitting trends on the synthetic dataset,' is concise but does not accurately describe the figure due to the lack of actual content. It should be revised once the figure is complete to reflect the specific trends or comparisons shown.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references imply that the figure demonstrates baseline versus variant performance and overfitting behavior on a synthetic dataset. However, the placeholder content prevents the figure from fulfilling this purpose. The references are clear in their intent, but the figure needs to be updated to align with them."
    },
    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The figure contains two panels labeled (a) and (b), each displaying placeholder filenames ('real_val.png' and 'variant_real_train.png') instead of actual data or plots. There are no labeled axes, legends, or discernible information in either panel.",
        "Img_review": "The figure does not contain any meaningful content and instead shows placeholder images. It lacks labeled axes, legends, and data visualizations. To be useful, the placeholders should be replaced with actual plots or visualizations relevant to the study. These should include all necessary elements to interpret the data, such as labeled axes and legends.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption, 'Performance comparison on a real-world dataset,' is overly generic and does not describe the figure's content. It fails to provide specific insights or summarize the takeaway from the figure. The caption should be rewritten to align with the actual content of the figure (once the placeholders are replaced).",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references to the figure suggest it should illustrate real-world results, including accuracy degradation and inconsistencies in model performance. However, the figure does not provide any information to support these claims due to the placeholders. The references are therefore inadequate and misaligned with the figure as it currently stands. The text should be revised to match the figure's content (once updated), or the figure should be updated to support the text's claims."
