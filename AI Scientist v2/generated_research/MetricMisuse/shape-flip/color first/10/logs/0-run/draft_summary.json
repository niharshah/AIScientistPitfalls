  "Experiment_description": "The experiments collectively aim to establish a robust baseline for converting Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR) sequences into graph representations using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). They explore various architectures, primarily utilizing GraphSAGE layers, to extract relational features for classification.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are crucial for understanding the efficacy of GNNs in SPR sequence classification. Establishing a reliable baseline helps identify strengths and weaknesses of the models, guiding future iterations to improve performance and address challenges like overfitting and class imbalance.",
  "Description": "The experiments involve constructing vocabularies, converting SPR sequences into graph representations, and applying Graph Neural Networks with GraphSAGE layers for classification. Metrics like Color-Weighted, Shape-Weighted, and Harmonic-Weighted accuracies are tracked to evaluate performance. The models are trained over several epochs, utilizing GPUs where available.",
