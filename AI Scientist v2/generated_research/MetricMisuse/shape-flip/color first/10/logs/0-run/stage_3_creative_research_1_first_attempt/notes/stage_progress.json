  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Successful experiments often involved careful tuning of hyperparameters, such as the number of training epochs. For instance, training for 30 epochs yielded the best validation performance in one experiment.\n\n- **Relational Modeling**: Incorporating relational edges that link tokens sharing the same color or shape consistently improved model performance. This approach enriched the graph structure and allowed the models to capture latent poly-factor rules more effectively.\n\n- **Complexity-Weighted Accuracy (CpxWA)**: Introducing and monitoring CpxWA as a holistic metric provided a more comprehensive evaluation of model performance, rewarding correct predictions on sequences with diverse shapes and colors.\n\n- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: The use of GNN architectures, such as GraphSAGE and Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCNs), was a common factor in successful experiments. These models effectively captured complex interactions within the data.\n\n- **Data Handling and Storage**: Successful experiments ensured that all metrics, losses, and predictions were stored systematically for later analysis, allowing for reproducibility and further experimentation.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Incorrect Layer Usage**: A failed experiment highlighted the importance of using the correct layers for specific tasks. For example, using GatedGraphConv with incorrect arguments led to execution failure. Understanding the capabilities and requirements of each layer is crucial.\n\n- **Overfitting**: Several experiments showed high validation accuracy but significantly lower test accuracy, indicating potential overfitting. This suggests a mismatch between training/validation and test data distributions.\n\n- **Misalignment with SOTA Benchmarks**: While some experiments achieved high validation accuracies, they did not surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks on test data, indicating room for improvement in generalization.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Layer Selection and Documentation**: Ensure that the chosen neural network layers are appropriate for the task and that their usage aligns with the official documentation. Consider using layers specifically designed for relational data, such as RGCNConv, when dealing with multiple edge types.\n\n- **Regularization Techniques**: Implement regularization techniques, such as dropout and weight decay, to mitigate overfitting. Additionally, consider using early stopping based on validation performance to prevent overfitting.\n\n- **Data Augmentation and Diversity**: To address potential overfitting and data distribution mismatches, explore data augmentation techniques and ensure that the training, validation, and test datasets are representative of each other.\n\n- **Comprehensive Metric Evaluation**: Continue using comprehensive metrics like CpxWA to evaluate model performance holistically. This will help in understanding the model's ability to generalize across diverse data scenarios.\n\n- **Experiment Documentation and Reproducibility**: Maintain thorough documentation of each experiment's design, execution, and results. This will facilitate reproducibility and allow for more informed adjustments in future experiments.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, future experiments can build on past successes while avoiding common pitfalls, ultimately leading to more robust and generalizable models."
