  "current_findings": "### Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Relation-Aware Message Passing**: The successful experiments utilized a Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) with explicit edge types (sequential order, same-shape linkage, and same-color linkage). This design achieved high validation performance, indicating the importance of incorporating relational biases to capture poly-factor regularities.\n\n- **Ablation Studies**: Various ablation studies were conducted to isolate the contributions of different components. These studies revealed that while the removal of certain features (e.g., shape embedding, positional embedding) led to performance drops, the model still maintained above-benchmark performance, highlighting the robustness of the core architecture.\n\n- **Concatenation of Embeddings**: The experiment that replaced early fusion by sum with concatenation of shape, color, and positional embeddings also showed high validation performance. This suggests that allowing the model to learn cross-modal interactions through graph layers can be beneficial.\n\n- **Consistent Training and Validation Metrics**: Across successful experiments, there was a consistent pattern of high training and validation metrics, indicating effective learning and model stability during these phases.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Overfitting**: A significant drop in test performance compared to validation metrics was a common issue, suggesting overfitting. This was observed in both successful and failed experiments, indicating a need for better generalization strategies.\n\n- **Lack of Edge Directionality**: The failed experiment with undirected edges showed that removing edge directionality can lead to overfitting, as the model loses critical source-target information.\n\n- **Limited Generalization**: Despite high validation performance, many experiments struggled with generalization to the test set, indicating potential issues with the training data's representativeness or model complexity.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Implement Regularization Techniques**: To combat overfitting, incorporate regularization methods such as dropout, weight decay, or early stopping based on validation performance. These techniques can help improve generalization to unseen data.\n\n- **Enhance Training Data Diversity**: Use data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training set. This can help the model learn more generalized patterns and improve test performance.\n\n- **Cross-Validation**: Employ cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness across different data subsets. This can provide a more reliable assessment of the model's generalization capabilities.\n\n- **Simplify Model Complexity**: Experiment with reducing model complexity by tuning hyperparameters or simplifying the architecture. This can help prevent overfitting and improve generalization.\n\n- **Analyze Test Data**: Conduct a thorough analysis of the test data to identify any discrepancies or patterns not well-represented in the training data. This can inform adjustments to the training process or data collection strategies.\n\nBy addressing these areas, future experiments can build on the successes while mitigating common pitfalls, leading to more robust and generalizable models."
