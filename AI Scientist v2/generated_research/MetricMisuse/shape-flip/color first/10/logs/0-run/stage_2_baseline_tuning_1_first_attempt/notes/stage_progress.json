  "current_findings": "### Comprehensive Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Baseline Model Design**: The initial baseline model using GraphSAGE with global mean pooling and a softmax classifier provided a solid foundation. This setup consistently achieved high validation accuracies across various experiments, indicating its robustness.\n\n- **Effective Hyperparameter Tuning**: \n  - **Epochs**: Increasing the number of training epochs improved validation performance, though it sometimes led to overfitting, as seen with the best validation HWA achieved at 30 epochs.\n  - **Learning Rate**: A learning rate sweep identified optimal values that balanced training speed and model performance, with the best results at moderate rates.\n  - **Batch Size**: Smaller batch sizes (e.g., 32) generally yielded better validation metrics, suggesting more stable gradient updates.\n  - **Embedding Dimension**: Larger embedding dimensions (e.g., 128) improved both validation and test accuracies, highlighting the importance of expressive feature representations.\n  - **Weight Decay**: Moderate weight decay values helped in regularizing the model, preventing overfitting.\n  - **Dropout Rate**: Lower dropout rates (e.g., 0.0) performed better, indicating that the model architecture was already robust to overfitting.\n\n- **Data Handling and Model Training**: The use of synthetic datasets as fallbacks ensured that experiments could run consistently, facilitating continuous testing and validation of model changes.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Attribute Errors**: The failed experiment with hidden dimensions highlighted a common pitfall of relying on undefined attributes in data structures (e.g., `dataset_split` in `DataLoader`). This indicates a need for careful management of data handling functions and ensuring compatibility with data structures.\n\n- **Overfitting**: Several experiments showed high validation accuracies but lower test accuracies, suggesting overfitting. This was particularly evident when tuning epochs and embedding dimensions.\n\n- **Inconsistent Data Splits**: Potential mismatch between training and test data distributions was observed, which could lead to misleading validation results.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Robust Data Handling**: Ensure that all data-related functions and attributes are well-defined and compatible with the data structures used. Avoid hardcoding attributes that may not exist in all contexts.\n\n- **Regularization Techniques**: To address overfitting, consider incorporating additional regularization techniques such as dropout, early stopping, or more aggressive weight decay.\n\n- **Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation to better assess model generalization and mitigate issues arising from data distribution mismatches.\n\n- **Incremental Hyperparameter Tuning**: Continue with systematic hyperparameter tuning but consider using automated tools like Optuna or Hyperopt for more efficient exploration.\n\n- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Implement thorough error handling and logging to quickly identify and resolve issues, especially those related to data processing and model training.\n\n- **Experiment Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation of each experiment, including configurations, results, and any anomalies, to facilitate reproducibility and further analysis.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, future experiments can build on the successes while avoiding common pitfalls, leading to more robust and generalizable models."
