    "Summary": "The paper investigates the robustness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in real-world scenarios, contrasting performance on synthetic benchmarks with results from noisier, real-world datasets. It attempts to highlight pitfalls in robustness and overfitting trends while providing some partial analyses of baseline versus variant models.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper raises an important issue: the gap between synthetic benchmarks and real-world performance for GNNs.",
        "It emphasizes the need for stress tests and robustness evaluation in practical deployments of GNNs."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The contributions are vague and lack novelty. While the problem of robustness is acknowledged, the paper does not propose meaningful or novel solutions to address it.",
        "The experiments are underdeveloped, with limited detail about the datasets, experimental setup, and metrics used. The lack of a thorough evaluation diminishes the impact of the findings.",
        "The writing is unclear in several places, with missing citations (e.g., '???') and incomplete methodological descriptions, making it difficult to assess the soundness of the claims.",
        "The results and figures are superficial, and no concrete insights or actionable takeaways are provided beyond general observations about overfitting and robustness issues.",
        "The paper admits it does not improve upon existing baselines, which further weakens its contribution to the field."
