% This foundational paper introduces Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), providing the theoretical basis for applying convolutional approaches to graph-structured data. It motivates the use of GCNs for tasks involving relational data, making it a highly relevant citation to support the methodology of using GNNs in the Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning task. This should be cited in the methods section when discussing the use of GNNs and their computational principles.

% This seminal paper introduces the Transformer architecture, which replaced recurrent and convolutional neural networks with a model based solely on attention mechanisms. It is foundational to the sequence-based models used as baselines in this study and should be cited in the related work section when discussing comparative baselines and their methodology.

% This foundational paper introduces Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCNs), designed to handle highly multi-relational data. It is directly relevant to the methodology section, as RGCNs were employed in the study to model the relational aspects of the Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning task. This citation supports the theoretical basis for using multi-relational GNNs in tasks involving structured and relational data.
