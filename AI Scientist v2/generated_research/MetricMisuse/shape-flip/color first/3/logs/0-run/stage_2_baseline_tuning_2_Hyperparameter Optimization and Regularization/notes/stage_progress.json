  "current_findings": "### Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Successful experiments consistently involved systematic hyperparameter tuning, such as adjusting `num_epochs`, `learning_rate`, `batch_size`, `weight_decay`, `embed_dim`, `dropout_rate`, and `gcn_hidden_dim`. Each parameter was varied systematically, and models were evaluated based on metrics like Balanced Weighted Accuracy (BWA), Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), and Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA).\n\n- **Early Stopping**: The use of early stopping based on validation set performance was effective in preventing overfitting and ensuring that the best model weights were retained.\n\n- **Data Management**: Successful experiments involved meticulous logging of results, including losses and accuracies for training, validation, and test sets. All data was stored in structured formats like `experiment_data.npy`, which facilitated easy retrieval and analysis.\n\n- **Visualization**: Generating plots of BWA curves for different configurations provided visual insights into model performance trends and helped in identifying the best hyperparameter settings.\n\n- **Reusability and Modularity**: Wrapping training and evaluation processes into reusable functions allowed for efficient experimentation and reduced redundancy in code.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Dataset Accessibility**: A major failure was due to the inability to locate the SPR_BENCH dataset, resulting in a FileNotFoundError. This highlights the importance of ensuring dataset availability and correct path configurations before running experiments.\n\n- **Overfitting**: While not a bug, overfitting was observed in some experiments where the test BWA was significantly lower than training and validation BWA. This suggests a need for better regularization techniques.\n\n- **Environment Configuration**: The lack of proper error handling or logging for dataset path issues can lead to confusion and wasted time. Clear instructions or automated checks for environment setup are crucial.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Dataset Management**: Ensure that datasets are correctly placed and accessible. Implement robust error handling to guide users in setting up the correct paths. Consider automating the dataset download and setup process if possible.\n\n- **Regularization Techniques**: To address overfitting, explore additional regularization methods such as L2 regularization, dropout, or data augmentation. Experiment with different dropout rates and weight decay values to find an optimal balance.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Exploration**: Continue systematic hyperparameter tuning, but consider using automated hyperparameter optimization techniques like Bayesian optimization or grid/random search to efficiently explore larger parameter spaces.\n\n- **Comprehensive Logging**: Maintain detailed logs of all experimental settings and results. This includes not only metrics but also configurations and any anomalies encountered during runs.\n\n- **Scalability and Reproducibility**: Ensure that experimental scripts are scalable and reproducible. Use version control for code and configurations, and consider containerization (e.g., Docker) to encapsulate the environment setup.\n\nBy following these recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes observed while mitigating the common pitfalls encountered."
