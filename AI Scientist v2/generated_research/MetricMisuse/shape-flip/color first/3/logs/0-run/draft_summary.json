  "Experiment_description": "The experiments involved testing various GNN architectures, such as GraphSAGE and GCN, for classifying SPR sequences by transforming them into graph structures and evaluating their performance using metrics like Balanced Weighted Accuracy (BWA).",
  "Significance": "Understanding the effectiveness of GNNs in processing SPR sequences is crucial for developing robust models that generalize well. These experiments provide insights into model generalization, overfitting, and the impact of architectural choices on performance.",
  "Description": "Each experiment transformed SPR sequences into graphs with defined node and edge structures, utilizing GNN architectures like GraphSAGE and GCN. Models were trained using cross-entropy loss and evaluated on metrics like BWA across training, validation, and test datasets.",
