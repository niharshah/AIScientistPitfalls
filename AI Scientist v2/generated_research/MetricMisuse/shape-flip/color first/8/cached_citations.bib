% This paper surveys symbolic techniques in deep learning, their limitations, and the integration of symbolic and non-symbolic methods. It is relevant for summarizing the background on symbolic reasoning tasks and contextualizing the challenges that the proposed GNN-based approach aims to address in the Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) task.
