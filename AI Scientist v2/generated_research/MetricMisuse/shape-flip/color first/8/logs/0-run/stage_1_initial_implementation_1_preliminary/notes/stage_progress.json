  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Graph Representation**: Successful experiments consistently represent SPR sequences as graphs, where nodes are symbols (tokens) and edges connect consecutive tokens. This graph-based approach provides a minimal yet meaningful relational structure that facilitates learning.\n\n- **Node Features**: Each node is described using a one-hot encoding of its shape and color, allowing the model to capture distinct features of each token.\n\n- **Model Architecture**: A simple 2-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is used, followed by global mean pooling and a linear classifier. This architecture has proven effective in capturing the relational patterns within the graph.\n\n- **Metrics Tracking**: Successful experiments track multiple metrics, including Cross-Entropy loss, plain accuracy, and Complexity-Weighted Accuracy (CompWA). This comprehensive tracking helps in understanding model performance across different dimensions.\n\n- **GPU Utilization**: The experiments efficiently utilize GPU resources, ensuring that all tensors and models are moved to the GPU when available, which enhances computational efficiency.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **DataLoader Issues**: A common issue arises from using the default PyTorch DataLoader, which is not compatible with PyTorch Geometric data objects. This leads to TypeErrors during batch collation.\n\n- **Dataset Path Errors**: Several failed experiments encountered FileNotFoundErrors due to incorrect dataset paths or missing dataset files. This highlights the importance of ensuring that dataset files are correctly located and paths are accurately specified in the script.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Custom DataLoader**: To avoid DataLoader issues, always use `torch_geometric.loader.DataLoader` instead of the default PyTorch DataLoader when working with PyTorch Geometric data.\n\n- **Dataset Management**: Ensure that dataset files are correctly placed in the specified directories. Consider implementing checks or prompts in the script to verify the presence of dataset files before execution.\n\n- **Experiment Logging**: Continue tracking a variety of metrics, including CompWA, to gain a comprehensive understanding of model performance. Consider adding more detailed logging or visualization of learning curves to facilitate deeper analysis.\n\n- **Model Complexity**: While the current simple GCN architecture is effective, explore the potential benefits of more complex architectures or additional layers to capture more intricate patterns in the data.\n\n- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and debugging mechanisms to quickly identify and resolve issues related to data paths and DataLoader configurations.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes of past experiments while avoiding common pitfalls, leading to more robust and effective models."
