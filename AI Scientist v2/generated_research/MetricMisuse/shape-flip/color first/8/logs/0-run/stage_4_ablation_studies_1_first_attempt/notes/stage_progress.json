  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Graph Construction and Node Features**: Successful experiments often involved meaningful graph construction and node feature encoding. For instance, treating each SPR sequence as a graph with nodes representing symbols and edges between consecutive tokens provided a minimal yet effective relational structure. The use of one-hot encoding for node features (shape and color) was a common theme.\n\n- **Model Architecture**: The use of a 2-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with global mean pooling followed by a linear classifier was effective in several experiments. This architecture was able to capture relational information and perform reasonably well across different setups.\n\n- **Ablation Studies**: Various ablation studies, such as \"Shape-Only Node Features\" and \"Sequence-Order Shuffled Graph,\" provided insights into the importance of different components. These studies highlighted that while some features could be removed without significant performance loss, others were crucial for maintaining accuracy.\n\n- **Data Handling and Logging**: Consistent data handling, logging, and saving of metrics were crucial for tracking progress and comparing different experimental setups. Successful experiments ensured that all components of the pipeline functioned as expected, with results saved and visualized appropriately.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Insufficient Graph Representation**: The \"No-Edge (Isolated-Nodes) Graph\" experiment demonstrated that removing meaningful edges can severely degrade model performance. The lack of inter-token edges resulted in the model not learning effectively, as evidenced by the stagnant validation accuracy and low Complexity-Weighted Accuracy.\n\n- **Data and Preprocessing Issues**: Potential issues with data preprocessing, such as incorrect token parsing or label mapping, can lead to poor model performance. Ensuring that the training data is representative and adequately preprocessed is critical.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiments that did not perform well often lacked sufficient hyperparameter tuning. Parameters such as learning rate, hidden dimensions, and batch size need careful consideration to optimize model performance.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Graph Construction**: Future experiments should focus on enhancing graph construction by ensuring that meaningful relationships are captured. Adding edges based on sequence relationships or exploring alternative graph topologies could improve performance.\n\n- **Comprehensive Ablation Studies**: Conduct more comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the effects of different components. This can help identify which features are essential and which can be modified or removed without significant performance loss.\n\n- **Data Quality and Quantity**: Ensure that the training data is of high quality and sufficiently large to represent the problem space. Consider augmenting the dataset or using synthetic data to improve model generalization.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Implement systematic hyperparameter optimization techniques to explore the parameter space more effectively. This could involve grid search, random search, or more advanced methods like Bayesian optimization.\n\n- **Robust Validation and Testing**: Implement robust validation and testing procedures to ensure that the model's performance is not a result of overfitting or data leakage. This includes using separate validation and test sets and ensuring that metrics are accurately calculated.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, future experiments can build on the successes and learn from the failures to achieve better performance and insights."
