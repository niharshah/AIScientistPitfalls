  "Experiment_description": "The experiments involve treating SPR sequences as graphs processed through a two-layer Graph Convolutional Network with global-mean pooling and a linear classifier. The focus is on assessing Cross-Entropy loss, accuracy, and Complexity-Weighted Accuracy across training and validation datasets.",
  "Significance": "These foundational experiments establish baseline performance and highlight areas needing improvement, such as class imbalance and overfitting. These findings are crucial for refining model architectures and training strategies in subsequent stages.",
  "Description": "Each node involves constructing a graph-based representation of SPR sequences with nodes as token-strings encoded by shape and color. A two-layer GCN with global-mean pooling processes these graphs. Performance is tracked using Cross-Entropy loss, accuracy, and Complexity-Weighted Accuracy, with computations optimized for GPU use.",
