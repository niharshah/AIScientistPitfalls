  "current_findings": "### Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Graph Construction and Enrichment**: Successful experiments often involved enriching the graph structure by adding additional edges, such as \"same-shape\" and \"same-color\" edges, which allowed the model to capture more complex relationships between tokens.\n\n- **Use of Advanced GNN Architectures**: Switching to more sophisticated GNN architectures like GraphSAGE with dropout and layer normalization generally led to better generalization and performance.\n\n- **Complexity-Weighted Metrics**: Tracking and optimizing for complexity-weighted metrics (such as Complexity-Weighted Accuracy) provided a more nuanced understanding of model performance and encouraged the model to learn more complex patterns.\n\n- **Early Stopping and Regularization**: Implementing early stopping and using regularization techniques like dropout and weight decay helped prevent overfitting and improved model robustness.\n\n- **GPU Utilization**: Ensuring that all tensors, models, and batches were moved to GPU when available significantly improved training efficiency and allowed for more complex models to be trained within reasonable time frames.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Insufficient Dataset Complexity**: Using synthetic datasets that were not complex enough led to models failing to learn meaningful patterns. It's crucial to ensure that training data is representative of the real-world complexity.\n\n- **Import and Path Errors**: Several experiments failed due to ImportErrors or FileNotFoundErrors, often because of incorrect module imports or dataset paths. Ensuring correct paths and imports is essential.\n\n- **Stagnant Metrics**: In some cases, metrics remained stagnant, indicating that the model was not learning effectively. This could be due to inadequate model complexity, poor hyperparameter choices, or insufficient data.\n\n- **Overfitting**: Some models showed signs of overfitting, with validation loss increasing over epochs. This suggests a need for better regularization and possibly more diverse training data.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Graph Structures**: Continue to explore richer graph structures that capture more complex relationships, such as using Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to better exploit relational information.\n\n- **Robust Dataset Handling**: Ensure that datasets are correctly placed and paths are dynamically handled to avoid system exits due to missing files. Consider using the original datasets rather than synthetic ones when possible.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Conduct systematic hyperparameter tuning, including learning rates, dropout rates, and hidden layer sizes, to find optimal configurations for different models.\n\n- **Model Complexity and Architecture**: Experiment with more advanced GNN architectures and consider adding more layers or neurons to increase model capacity.\n\n- **Data Augmentation and Preprocessing**: Increase the size and diversity of the training dataset through data augmentation techniques to improve generalization.\n\n- **Regularization and Early Stopping**: Implement regularization techniques and early stopping to prevent overfitting and ensure that models do not train beyond the point of diminishing returns.\n\n- **Comprehensive Metric Tracking**: Continue to track a wide range of metrics, including complexity-weighted metrics, to gain a comprehensive understanding of model performance and areas for improvement.\n\nBy addressing these areas, future experiments can build on past successes and avoid common pitfalls, leading to more robust and effective models."
