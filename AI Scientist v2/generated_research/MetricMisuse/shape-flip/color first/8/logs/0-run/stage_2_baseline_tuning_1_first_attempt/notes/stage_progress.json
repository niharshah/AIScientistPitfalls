  "current_findings": "### Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Graph-Based Design**: The use of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to treat SPR sequences as graphs has shown promise. This approach leverages the relational structure of data, which is crucial for capturing dependencies between tokens.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic hyperparameter tuning, such as adjusting the number of epochs, learning rate, batch size, and hidden layer dimensions, has led to improvements in model performance. For instance, increasing the hidden dimension to 256 improved the Complexity-Weighted Accuracy (CompWA) to 0.5528.\n\n- **Model Architecture**: The choice of a 2-layer GCN with global-mean pooling followed by a linear classifier has been effective in achieving reasonable accuracy and loss metrics.\n\n- **Early Stopping**: Implementing early stopping based on validation loss has helped prevent overfitting and ensured that the model does not train unnecessarily long, which is particularly useful in experiments with limited data.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Stagnant Performance Across Hyperparameters**: Several experiments showed stagnant performance across different hyperparameters, such as weight decay, dropout rates, and number of GCN layers. This suggests that the model might not be learning effectively due to limitations in data complexity or model capacity.\n\n- **Limited Dataset Size**: The small size of the synthetic dataset (200 training examples) has been a recurring issue, leading to poor generalization and low CompWA. This limitation affects the model's ability to capture meaningful patterns.\n\n- **Underfitting**: The model often underfits the data, as indicated by high validation loss and low CompWA. This suggests that the model architecture might be too simplistic or that the dataset lacks sufficient complexity.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Dataset Complexity**: Increase the size and complexity of the dataset to provide the model with more diverse examples. This could involve generating more synthetic data or incorporating real-world data if applicable.\n\n- **Explore Advanced Architectures**: Experiment with more complex GCN architectures or alternative graph neural network models that might capture more intricate patterns in the data.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Exploration**: Continue to explore a wider range of hyperparameters, including more aggressive learning rates, larger batch sizes, and deeper networks, to find optimal settings.\n\n- **Regularization Techniques**: Introduce regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and improve model robustness.\n\n- **Optimization Strategies**: Experiment with different optimizers, such as AdamW or RMSprop, which might offer better convergence properties for the given task.\n\n- **Feature Engineering**: Investigate additional features or transformations that could be applied to the input data to enhance the model's learning capability.\n\nBy addressing these areas, future experiments can build on the successes and learn from the failures to achieve better model performance and generalization."
