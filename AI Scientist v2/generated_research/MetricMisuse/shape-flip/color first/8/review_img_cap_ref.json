        "Img_description": "Figure 1 comprises two subfigures. Subfigure (a) contains two plots: a loss curve and an accuracy curve, both showing training and validation trends over epochs. The loss curve shows training loss decreasing and plateauing, while validation loss decreases initially but rises later, suggesting overfitting. The accuracy curve shows training accuracy increasing steadily, while validation accuracy plateaus early. Subfigure (b) is a confusion matrix for a binary classification problem, revealing a strong bias towards predicting 'Class 0.'",
        "Img_review": "The figure is clear in presenting the intended information, but it has some weaknesses. Subfigure (a) lacks a legend to label the training and validation curves explicitly, which could confuse readers. Subfigure (b)\u2019s confusion matrix does not display the exact numerical values for each cell, making interpretation dependent on the gradient. Adding a legend to subfigure (a) and numerical values to subfigure (b) would improve clarity and interpretability.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption is accurate but could be more concise. It correctly identifies overfitting in subfigure (a) and class imbalance in subfigure (b). Phrasing such as 'dominated by one class prediction' could be more specific (e.g., 'dominated by predictions for Class 0'). Additionally, the caption could better emphasize the key takeaways while avoiding overly verbose descriptions.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure well, providing numerical context for the trends observed in the figure. It highlights overfitting and class imbalance effectively. However, it does not critically discuss the absence of a legend in subfigure (a) or the lack of numerical values in subfigure (b). Explicitly addressing these limitations would improve the integration of the figure into the discussion."
    },
    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The figure contains two subplots. The left subplot shows training curves for a Depth-1 GCN with epochs on the x-axis and two y-axes for loss and accuracy. Two curves represent the loss and accuracy trends over training epochs. The right subplot is a confusion matrix for two classes ('Class 0' and 'Class 1'), showing predictions entirely skewed toward 'Class 0'.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is clear but could benefit from improvements. The training curves subplot lacks explicit line labels for 'Loss' and 'Accuracy,' which would enhance clarity. The confusion matrix could include numerical values in the cells to improve interpretability. Additionally, providing the dataset/task in the figure or caption would add useful context.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption is concise and aligns with the figure content, accurately describing overfitting and class skew. However, it could include additional context, such as the dataset/task or metrics shown in the training curves, to improve informativeness.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The figure lacks references in the main text ([]). This omission significantly reduces the figure's integration into the paper. Proper references should discuss the evidence of overfitting and class imbalance, explain the significance of the Depth-1 GCN, and provide context on the dataset/task."
    },
    "figure_3": {
        "Img_description": "The figure contains two panels. Panel (a) features two plots: a loss curve showing 'Loss' vs. 'Epochs' and an accuracy curve showing 'Accuracy' vs. 'Epochs' for a Directed-edge GCN approach. Both plots include separate lines for training and validation metrics, with trends indicating an early improvement followed by a plateau. Panel (b) is a confusion matrix with 'Ground Truth' on the y-axis and 'Predicted' on the x-axis, showing prediction counts for two classes. Color intensity reflects the magnitude of these counts.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is clear but could be improved. Panel (a) would benefit from gridlines to enhance readability of the loss/accuracy trends. Panel (b) should include a color bar for interpreting the color intensities quantitatively. Consistent font sizes and legibility across both panels would further enhance clarity.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption is vague and does not describe the figure explicitly. It should be expanded to summarize the contents of both panels and specify what the 'pitfalls' are. A suggestion: 'Panel (a) shows the training and validation loss/accuracy curves for the Directed-edge GCN approach, highlighting a plateau in performance. Panel (b) displays the confusion matrix, revealing the breakdown of prediction counts for two classes.'",
        "Figrefs_review": "The figure is not referenced in the main text (`[]`), which leaves the reader without context or interpretation. The main text should integrate the figure by explaining the purpose of the displayed metrics and how they relate to the 'pitfalls' mentioned in the caption."

        "Img_description": "The figure comprises two subfigures: (a) a graph showing the 'Fully Connected Loss Curve' and 'Fully Connected Accuracy Curve' with epochs on the x-axis and loss/accuracy on the y-axis. The curves illustrate training performance over time. (b) A confusion matrix titled 'Fully Connected Confusion Matrix,' showing prediction distribution across two classes (Class 0 and Class 1), with shading indicating the magnitude of values.",
        "Img_review": "The figure provides useful information but has room for improvement. Subfigure (a) lacks a legend to differentiate the curves, and subfigure (b) could display numerical values within the confusion matrix cells for clarity. Additionally, there is no indication of validation metrics to assess overfitting. Overall, the figure does not strongly support the claim of overfitting or class imbalance, as evidence for overfitting is absent and class imbalance is not explicitly emphasized.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption, 'Fully connected GCN variant does not alleviate overfitting or class imbalance,' is concise but does not fully align with the figure. While the confusion matrix hints at class imbalance, the lack of validation data in the loss and accuracy curves makes it difficult to assess overfitting. The caption could be revised to better reflect the figure's content.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references for the figure are missing ('[]'), leaving the figure without context or explanation. This omission weakens the integration of the figure into the paper and hinders the reader's ability to understand its purpose or relevance."

        "Img_description": "The figure consists of two subplots: (a) depicts the loss and accuracy curves under shuffled token order, with clear axes labels (Epochs vs. Loss/Accuracy) and a legend for training and validation metrics. Subplot (b) shows a confusion matrix for the same experiment with color-coded cells and numeric annotations, summarizing class-wise performance.",
        "Img_review": "Subplot (a) is clear but could benefit from additional annotations to highlight overfitting or key trends. Subplot (b) lacks a color bar to explain the intensity of values and does not directly link adjacency to the observed performance. Overall, the figure is readable but could be more informative with added context and visual aids.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption is concise but does not fully describe the figure. While it mentions overfitting, it does not detail the insights from the confusion matrix or directly connect the figure to the claim about adjacency. Adding more detail would improve clarity.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The references in the main text are missing ([]). This leaves the figure disconnected from the paper's narrative, making it harder for readers to understand its purpose or context."

        "Img_description": "The figure consists of two panels. Panel (a) contains two line plots showing 'Shape-Only Loss/Accuracy' with subplots for loss and accuracy trends over training epochs. Panel (b) is a confusion matrix heatmap for shape-only classification, with perfect accuracy shown for two classes (Class 0 and Class 1).",
        "Img_review": "Panel (a) lacks a legend, making it unclear what the lines represent (e.g., training vs. validation). Panel (b) is clear in presenting confusion matrix data, but neither panel directly supports the claim about 'color-based reasoning' degradation. The figure could benefit from additional annotations and overlays to connect it to the paper's narrative.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption claims that 'Shape-only edges degrade color-based reasoning but still reflect the same key pitfalls,' but the figure does not directly demonstrate or provide evidence for this claim. The caption should better align with the figure's actual content.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references are missing (`[]`). Without context or explanation in the text, the figure's purpose and connection to the broader narrative are unclear. Detailed references and integration into the text are necessary."
