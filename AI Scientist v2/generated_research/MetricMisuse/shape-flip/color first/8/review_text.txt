    "Summary": "This paper investigates the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for the Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) task, where sequences of symbolic tokens are classified based on hidden poly-factor rules. A simple GCN-based architecture is proposed to capture relational dependencies in the data. While the approach is intuitive, the experimental results reveal significant limitations, including overfitting and class imbalance, which are not adequately addressed. The contributions are marginal, and the technical novelty is limited.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper identifies an interesting problem in symbolic reasoning and proposes a relational approach using GNNs.",
        "The use of GNNs to capture structural dependencies in symbolic data is a potentially valuable idea.",
        "The evaluation considers weighted metrics that reflect complexities in symbolic reasoning tasks."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The proposed method is technically simplistic and lacks significant innovation. It merely applies a standard GCN to the SPR task without introducing new techniques or insights.",
        "The experimental results are poor, with issues such as overfitting, class imbalance, and marginal improvements in performance over baseline methods.",
        "The paper does not provide meaningful solutions to the key issues it identifies, such as overfitting and class imbalance.",
        "The evaluation metrics are inadequate for demonstrating the superiority of the proposed approach. The experiments fail to show substantial improvements over existing methods.",
        "The paper does not compare its approach to state-of-the-art sequence models (e.g., Transformers), which may perform better on this task.",
        "Hyperparameter choices and design decisions are not thoroughly justified, and the analysis of results is superficial.",
        "The related work section is sparse and lacks citations to relevant literature on GNNs and symbolic reasoning."

    "Questions": [
        "How does the proposed GNN approach compare to state-of-the-art sequence-based methods like Transformers?",
        "What steps were taken to mitigate overfitting and class imbalance? Why were these steps ineffective?",
        "Why does the paper use a basic GCN instead of more advanced graph-based architectures?",

    "Limitations": [
        "The paper fails to adequately address key challenges such as overfitting and class imbalance.",
        "The proposed method is not robust enough to handle complex symbolic reasoning tasks, as evidenced by the mediocre experimental results."
