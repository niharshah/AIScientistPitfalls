% This paper introduces GraphSAGE, an inductive framework for generating node embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood. This foundational method is directly referenced in the proposed research as it is used to process symbolic sequences represented as graphs. This citation should be included where the methodology involving GraphSAGE is discussed.

% The paper 'Learning Discriminative Relational Features for Sequence Labeling' critiques conventional sequence labeling methods, such as HMMs and CRFs, for their limitations in discovering interactions and relational structures among inputs. This work is relevant for supporting the argument in the related work section that sequence-based models (e.g., LSTMs, Transformers) may not fully exploit the relational and structural information inherent in tasks like SPR. It underscores the need for alternative approaches, such as GNNs, which are better suited for tasks involving relational data.

% This paper explores the use of rule-guided Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for explainable reasoning over knowledge graphs, demonstrating how symbolic rules can guide GNN training to simulate rule reasoning and improve interpretability. It is relevant to the proposed research as it supports the hypothesis that GNNs can effectively capture relational structures and simulate rule reasoning in symbolic tasks like SPR. This citation should be included in the related work section when discussing prior efforts in using GNNs for symbolic reasoning tasks.
