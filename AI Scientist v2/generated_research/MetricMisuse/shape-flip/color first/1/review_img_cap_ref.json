    "figure_1": {
        "Img_description": "The figure consists of two subplots labeled (a) and (b). Subplot (a) references 'baseline,' and subplot (b) includes text about 'Color-/shape-.' However, the axes, legends, and visual clarity of the content are missing, and the figure is not interpretable in its current form.",
        "Img_review": "The figure lacks clarity and interpretability. Axes, legends, and clear trends (e.g., training/validation curves, accuracy) are missing. The contents of subplots (a) and (b) are unclear, and the figure does not fulfill its purported purpose.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption, 'Baseline GNN results,' is too generic and does not describe the figure's content in detail. A more specific caption explaining what is shown in subplots (a) and (b) is needed.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references describe a figure combining training/validation curves and accuracy trends, but the provided figure does not visually support these claims. The figure and its text references are misaligned, leading to confusion."
    },
    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The image contains two subplots arranged side by side. Subplot (a) seems to depict training and validation loss over epochs, though the axes are not clearly labeled. Subplot (b) appears to show weighted accuracy, possibly across categories or instances, but lacks explicit axis labels and a legend. Both subplots are sparse and poorly annotated, making interpretation difficult.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is poorly labeled and lacks critical components such as axis titles, legends, and any indication of the ablation results mentioned in the main text. This hinders the reader's ability to interpret the results or draw meaningful conclusions. Adding clear labels, legends, and visualizing ablation effects would significantly improve the figure.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption, 'Relation-aware GNN results,' is overly vague and does not provide any specific information about the contents of the figure. It should be expanded to explicitly describe the training/validation loss, weighted accuracy, and the key insights or trends illustrated in the plots.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references Figure 2 but does not sufficiently describe its content or purpose. While it mentions the illustration of training/validation loss and weighted accuracy, the figure does not include the ablation results discussed in the text. This lack of alignment between the figure and its references creates confusion and diminishes the figure's utility."
