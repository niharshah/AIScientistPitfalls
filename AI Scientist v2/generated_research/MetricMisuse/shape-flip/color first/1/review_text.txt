    "Summary": "The paper highlights challenges in graph neural networks (GNNs) where scaling up data or increasing relational complexity does not guarantee performance improvements, particularly under weighted accuracy metrics. It provides analyses and ablations to demonstrate these phenomena on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper addresses an important and practical challenge in GNN research: the assumption that more data or richer relationships always improve performance.",
        "The focus on weighted accuracy metrics is relevant for real-world imbalanced settings."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper fails to provide a clear methodological innovation. It primarily restates known issues (e.g., imbalanced performance in GNNs) without introducing novel solutions or techniques.",
        "The experimental setup is insufficiently detailed, making it difficult to assess the rigor of the analyses or reproduce the results. For example, there is no description of the dataset size, training parameters, or the exact implementation of weighted accuracy metrics.",
        "The results and figures presented (e.g., training/validation curves, weighted accuracy trends) are superficial and lack depth. The paper does not offer insights into why specific behaviors occur or how they can be mitigated.",
        "The related work section is shallow and fails to situate the contributions of this paper within the broader GNN and graph representation learning literature.",
        "The recommendations offered are generic and do not provide actionable guidelines for researchers or practitioners.",
        "The appendix and references are incomplete or placeholders (e.g., '[?]' is used instead of proper citations). This reflects a lack of thoroughness in the submission."

    "Questions": [
        "What is the novel contribution of this paper beyond highlighting known pitfalls in GNNs?",
        "Can the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets, including their size, the number of classes, and the specifics of the color-/shape-weighted accuracy metrics?",
        "How are the ablations conducted, and what are the precise changes made to the graph relationships? Are these changes generalizable to real-world datasets?",
        "What steps can practitioners take to avoid these pitfalls in practical GNN applications, based on the findings of this paper?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not propose any concrete methods or strategies to address the identified pitfalls in GNNs.",
        "The lack of experimental rigor and clarity severely limits the reproducibility and trustworthiness of the results."
