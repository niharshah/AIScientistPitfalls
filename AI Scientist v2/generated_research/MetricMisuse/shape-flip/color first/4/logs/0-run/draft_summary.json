  "Experiment_description": "The experiments involved using graph neural networks, specifically variations of the GraphSAGE encoder, to classify SPR sequences represented as small graphs. These graphs had nodes representing tokens (shape and color), connected by bidirectional edges.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are important as they explore the potential of graph neural networks in effectively classifying SPR sequences. The high CWA2 accuracies achieved indicate that graph-based models can capture complex dependencies in structured data, providing a foundation for further improvements and applications in similar domains.",
  "Description": "Each experiment converted SPR sequences into graph representations with nodes as tokens and edges connecting adjacent tokens. GraphSAGE encoders with global mean-pooling were used to generate embeddings, followed by classification through linear layers. The Complexity-Weighted Accuracy (CWA2) was a key metric across all nodes, providing a consistent measure of performance.",
