  "current_findings": "## Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Graph-Based Design**: The successful experiments consistently utilized a graph-based design where each token in a sequence was converted into a node with attributes, and adjacent tokens were connected by edges. This design allowed for effective representation and processing of the data.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic hyperparameter tuning played a crucial role in improving model performance. Experiments that varied parameters such as epochs, learning rate, batch size, embedding dimensions, weight decay, dropout probability, hidden dimensions, and max gradient norm showed significant improvements in metrics like training loss, validation loss, and Complexity-Weighted Accuracy (CWA2).\n\n- **Efficient Use of Resources**: The experiments efficiently utilized available resources, such as moving tensors and models to GPU and transferring batches inside the loop, which contributed to faster execution and better performance.\n\n- **Consistent Logging and Saving**: Successful experiments maintained a robust logging mechanism, storing all metrics, losses, predictions, and ground-truth data in a structured dictionary and saving it for further analysis. This practice ensured that results were reproducible and could be easily analyzed.\n\n- **Convergence and Improvement**: The experiments demonstrated consistent improvements in performance metrics across epochs, indicating effective training and convergence of the models.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Lack of Experimentation with Failed Configurations**: The summary does not provide details on failed experiments, which suggests a potential gap in exploring and learning from configurations that did not work. Understanding why certain configurations fail is crucial for comprehensive model improvement.\n\n- **Overfitting Risks**: While not explicitly mentioned, there is always a risk of overfitting when tuning hyperparameters extensively. It's important to monitor for signs of overfitting, such as a large gap between training and validation performance.\n\n- **Limited Dataset Variability**: The experiments primarily focused on the SPR_BENCH dataset. Relying on a single dataset may limit the generalizability of the findings. Exploring diverse datasets could provide more robust insights.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Explore Failed Configurations**: Actively document and analyze configurations that do not yield improvements. Understanding failure modes can provide valuable insights into model limitations and guide future experimentation.\n\n- **Monitor for Overfitting**: Implement regular checks for overfitting by comparing training and validation metrics. Consider techniques like early stopping or regularization to mitigate overfitting risks.\n\n- **Diversify Datasets**: Experiment with a variety of datasets to ensure that the model's performance is robust and generalizable across different types of data.\n\n- **Incremental Complexity**: Gradually increase model complexity and hyperparameter ranges to avoid overwhelming the model with too many changes at once. This approach can help isolate the impact of individual changes.\n\n- **Cross-Validation**: Incorporate cross-validation to ensure that the model's performance is consistent across different data splits, providing a more reliable assessment of its capabilities.\n\n- **Detailed Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation of all experiments, including both successes and failures, to build a comprehensive knowledge base for future research and development efforts."
