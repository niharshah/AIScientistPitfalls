  "current_findings": "## Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Graph Enrichment**: Successful experiments consistently enriched the graph structure by adding relational edges that connect tokens sharing the same color or shape. This approach allowed the Graph Neural Network (GNN) to effectively pass messages along latent rule carriers, improving the model's ability to capture complex relationships.\n\n- **Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCN)**: The use of R-GCNs, which explicitly distinguish between different types of edges (order, same-color, same-shape), proved to be effective. This allowed the model to reason differently over various types of connections, leading to improved performance metrics.\n\n- **Node Feature Representation**: Effective experiments incorporated comprehensive node features, including shape, color, and position embeddings. These features were either concatenated or summed to provide a rich context for the GNN to process.\n\n- **Complexity-Weighted Accuracy (CompWA)**: Monitoring and optimizing for CompWA, alongside other weighted accuracies, provided a more nuanced evaluation of model performance, especially in handling complex sequences.\n\n- **Self-Contained and Robust Scripts**: Successful experiments ensured that scripts were self-contained, GPU-aware, and capable of falling back to synthetic datasets if the real dataset was unavailable. This robustness ensured consistent execution and evaluation.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiments that involved hyperparameter tuning, such as varying the number of epochs, provided insights into optimal training durations and improved model performance.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Lack of Relational Awareness**: Models that did not incorporate relational awareness or distinguish between different types of edges tended to underperform. This highlights the importance of explicitly modeling relational dependencies.\n\n- **Insufficient Node Features**: Experiments that did not fully leverage node features, such as shape, color, and position, were less successful. Comprehensive feature representation is crucial for capturing the complexities of the data.\n\n- **Overfitting Due to Long Training**: While not explicitly mentioned, the risk of overfitting is inherent in experiments with prolonged training without early stopping mechanisms. Monitoring validation metrics and implementing early stopping can mitigate this risk.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Relational Modeling**: Continue to explore and refine relational modeling techniques, such as R-GCNs, to further improve the model's ability to capture complex dependencies.\n\n- **Optimize Node Feature Representation**: Experiment with different ways of representing and combining node features to provide the GNN with the richest possible context.\n\n- **Focus on Weighted Accuracies**: Prioritize metrics like CompWA, CWA, and SWA to ensure the model performs well on complex and diverse sequences. Consider developing new weighted metrics that might capture other aspects of the data.\n\n- **Robustness and Self-Containment**: Ensure all experimental scripts are robust, self-contained, and capable of running with fallback datasets. This will facilitate consistent experimentation and evaluation.\n\n- **Explore Advanced Techniques**: Consider integrating advanced techniques such as attention mechanisms or curriculum learning to further enhance model performance.\n\n- **Regular Hyperparameter Tuning**: Regularly perform hyperparameter tuning to identify optimal training configurations, such as epoch counts and learning rates, to maximize model performance.\n\nBy building on these insights and recommendations, future experiments can continue to push the boundaries of performance and robustness in GNN-based models."
