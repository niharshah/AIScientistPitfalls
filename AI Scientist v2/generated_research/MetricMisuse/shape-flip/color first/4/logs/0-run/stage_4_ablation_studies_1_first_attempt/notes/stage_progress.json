  "current_findings": "### Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Multi-Relational Graph Design**: Successful experiments often utilized a multi-relational graph design where each token is a node, and edges are labeled with specific relation types (order, same-color, same-shape). This design allowed the model to leverage relational information effectively.\n\n- **Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCN)**: Implementing RGCN layers that natively handle relation types contributed significantly to the model's performance. This approach allowed for more nuanced message passing between nodes based on their relationships.\n\n- **Ablation Studies**: Conducting ablation studies, such as removing color edges or positional embeddings, helped isolate the structural contributions of different components. These studies demonstrated the importance of each feature in the model's overall performance.\n\n- **Bug Fixes and Adjustments**: Addressing issues like batch size mismatches by pooling node embeddings and classifying graph-level embeddings improved model stability and performance. This approach ensured that the model's output dimensions matched the expected target dimensions.\n\n- **Metric Tracking and Logging**: Consistent tracking of various metrics (CWA, SWA, CompWA, DWA) and losses provided a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance across different datasets and conditions.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Batch Size Mismatches**: A common failure pattern was the mismatch between the model's output batch size and the target batch size. This issue often arose from inconsistencies in data batching or processing within the DataLoader or model architecture.\n\n- **Simplified Graph Designs**: Experiments that collapsed edge types or removed essential embeddings (e.g., shape/color embeddings) showed reduced performance, highlighting the importance of maintaining rich relational information.\n\n- **Over-Simplification in Ablations**: Some ablation studies, such as the Uniform-Node-Feature ablation, led to significant performance drops, indicating that oversimplifying node features can hinder the model's ability to capture complex relationships.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Ensure Consistent Data Processing**: Verify that batch sizes are consistent throughout the data pipeline. Double-check DataLoader settings and ensure that input data and labels are batched correctly to avoid dimension mismatches.\n\n- **Leverage Multi-Relational Graphs**: Continue using multi-relational graph designs with RGCN layers to capture complex relational information. This approach has consistently shown to enhance model performance.\n\n- **Conduct Comprehensive Ablation Studies**: Use ablation studies to understand the contribution of each model component. However, avoid oversimplifying the model, as this can lead to performance degradation.\n\n- **Implement Robust Metric Tracking**: Maintain comprehensive metric tracking and logging to monitor the model's performance across different conditions. This practice will help identify areas for improvement and ensure robust evaluation.\n\n- **Address Known Issues Promptly**: Quickly address known issues, such as batch size mismatches, by implementing pooling strategies or adjusting model architectures to ensure compatibility with target dimensions.\n\nBy following these recommendations and learning from both successful and failed experiments, future research can build on existing progress and continue to improve model performance."
