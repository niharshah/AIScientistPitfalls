        "Img_description": "Figure 1 contains four subfigures: (a) Train vs. Validation Loss, showing loss vs. epochs with both train and validation loss decreasing over 20 epochs, though validation loss has minor fluctuations; (b) Overlaid Loss Curves (Zoom View), providing a detailed view of the loss curves with a persistent gap; (c) Validation Weighted Accuracies, showing CWA, SWA, and CompWA over epochs, with CWA rising more steeply than SWA; and (d) Test Weighted Accuracies, a bar chart comparing final metrics for CWA, SWA, and CompWA, highlighting superior CWA performance.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is informative and effectively visualizes the described model behaviors. Suggestions for improvement include adding gridlines to subfigures (a) and (b), including legends directly in (a), (b), (c), and (d), and adding error bars to the bar chart in (d) to show variability.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption is accurate and aligns with the figure, summarizing key points effectively. It could be made more concise to improve readability while retaining the main takeaway that the model performs better on color-based reasoning than shape-based reasoning.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references adequately describe the figure's content and context but could be enhanced with more specific numerical observations, such as the exact gap in loss or final accuracy values. Overall, the references integrate the figure well into the narrative."
    },
    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The figure contains three subplots (a, b, c), each presenting aspects of ablation studies on graph modifications. Subfigure (a) shows a line plot comparing performance with collapsed edge types, subfigure (b) shows performance without color edges, and subfigure (c) combines a line plot and bar chart to evaluate the effect of uniform node features. However, all subplots lack clear axis labels, legends, and annotations, which makes interpretation difficult.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is poorly labeled and lacks essential elements like legends, axis titles, and annotations. The absence of these makes it challenging to understand what the data represents or how the metrics are derived. Additionally, the bar chart in subfigure (c) is ambiguous, with no clear indication of what the bars represent. Adding legends, axis labels, and more detailed annotations would significantly improve the figure's interpretability.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption provides a general idea of the figure's purpose but does not explicitly link the described modifications and metrics to specific subfigures. It mentions significant performance drops but does not specify where these drops are visible in the figure. The caption could be expanded to include specific references to each subfigure and the metrics shown.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references provide a general overview of the figure's purpose but lack detailed explanations of the subfigures' content. They do not clarify how the described metrics (CWA, SWA, CompWA) are represented or how specific ablation scenarios relate to the trends shown. Including a more detailed explanation of the figure's axes, trends, and subfigure contexts would improve comprehension."
