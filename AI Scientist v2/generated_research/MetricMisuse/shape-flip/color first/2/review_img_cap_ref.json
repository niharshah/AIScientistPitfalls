        "Img_description": "The figure contains two subplots comparing different pooling strategies (mean, max, add, attn) for a GNN on the SPR_BENCH dataset. Subplot (a) shows training and validation loss decreasing over epochs, with max pooling achieving slightly better convergence. Subplot (b) shows validation Dual Weighted Accuracy (DWA) improving over epochs, with max pooling achieving the highest final DWA.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is clear and well-structured, with appropriate axis labels and a helpful legend. However, the legend's font size could be increased for better readability. The scale of the Y-axis in the DWA plot could be clarified to ensure it does not exaggerate differences. Including error bars or confidence intervals would enhance the figure's informativeness.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption effectively describes the figure and emphasizes the superiority of max pooling. However, it could be more concise and focus on the key takeaway. Adding a brief explanation of DWA or context about the SPR_BENCH dataset would improve clarity.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure adequately, highlighting key observations and the superiority of max pooling. However, a more nuanced discussion of loss trends (subplot a) and the connection between loss and DWA across pooling methods would provide additional insights."
    },
    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The figure consists of two subplots: (a) 'Loss Curves' showing Training vs. Validation Cross Entropy Loss over Epochs, and (b) 'PCWA Curves' showing Training vs. Validation PCWA over Epochs. Both subplots are well-labeled with x-axes for 'Epoch,' y-axes for respective metrics, and a clear legend distinguishing 'Train' and 'Validation' data.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is clear, with appropriately labeled axes and a legend. The trends are interpretable, showing a steady decrease in training loss, a plateau in validation loss, and a delayed rise in validation PCWA. Potential improvements include: adding intermediate x-axis ticks for better granularity, making the legend more descriptive, and ensuring consistent line styles for better readability.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption is accurate and concise, summarizing the figure's content well. It mentions the delayed jump in validation PCWA, which is visible in the figure. However, the caption could explicitly state the epochs at which the plateauing and spike occur, as well as the implications for model performance.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure adequately, discussing the trends seen in the subplots (e.g., decreasing training loss, plateauing validation loss, and delayed PCWA jump). However, the references could provide more precise details about the figure, such as specific epochs or values highlighted in the plots."
    },
    "figure_3": {
        "Img_description": "The figure is a bar chart titled 'Baseline: Final DWA by Pooling Type \u2013 SPR_BENC'. The x-axis lists different pooling types ('mean', 'max', 'add', 'attn'), and the y-axis denotes the 'Final Dual Weighted Accuracy' ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. The bar heights indicate the accuracy for each pooling type, with 'max' pooling yielding the highest value.",
        "Img_review": "The bar chart is well-labeled with a clear title and axis names. However, it lacks error bars to indicate variability or confidence, and there is no legend to provide additional context. While the chart effectively communicates the performance difference between pooling types, it could be improved with annotations or highlights to emphasize the key takeaway.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption accurately describes the chart's content, noting that 'max' pooling achieves higher accuracy. However, it is somewhat brief and does not provide deeper analysis or implications of the observed trend. Expanding the caption to include potential reasons for 'max pooling's' superior performance or its broader significance would add value.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure and aligns with its content by noting the gains from 'max pooling.' However, the discussion does not explore statistical significance, variability, or potential reasons behind the observed trends, which would strengthen the argument and better integrate the figure into the narrative."
    },
    "figure_4": {
        "Img_description": "The figure is a bar chart divided into three sections (A, B, C), labeled as 'max8_balanced,' 'max12_shapebias,' and 'max20_colorbias,' respectively. Each section displays four bars representing different metrics: ACC, PCWA, CWA, and SWA. The y-axis is labeled 'Score' and spans from 0.0 to 1.0. A legend in the top right identifies the color coding for the metrics.",
        "Img_review": "The bar chart is clear and well-structured, with distinct color coding and proper axis labeling. However, it lacks error bars to show variability or statistical significance and does not highlight key trends or observations. The x-axis labels could be shortened to improve readability, with additional details provided in the main text or caption.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption is concise and accurately describes the figure as an ablation study showcasing final test metrics across various splits. However, it could be improved by explicitly mentioning the metrics (ACC, PCWA, CWA, SWA) and summarizing the primary takeaway, such as which metric or approach performs best.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure reasonably well, noting its purpose and connection to the refined GNN model's performance. However, it lacks specific analysis of the trends shown in the figure, such as which metric performs best or how the splits affect performance. Including such details would improve clarity and integration."
    },
    "figure_5": {
        "Img_description": "The figure is a line plot titled 'Ablation (First-Node Readout): PCWA Curves.' It shows two curves, 'Train PCWA' and 'Validation PCWA,' plotted against the x-axis labeled 'Epoch.' The y-axis is labeled 'PCWA.' The 'Train PCWA' curve slightly increases before stabilizing, while the 'Validation PCWA' curve remains nearly constant. The x-axis spans from 1.0 to 6.0 epochs, and the y-axis ranges from 0.7050 to 0.7175.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is well-labeled with a clear title, axes, and legend. However, it does not present significant trends or distinctions between the curves that strongly support the stated conclusion of reduced capacity or struggles in capturing color-shape interactions. Its informativeness is limited without additional context or indicators. Adding annotations or visual emphasis could improve clarity.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption correctly identifies the figure's focus on first-node readout and PCWA curves but overstates the visual evidence for the claims of reduced capacity and struggles with color-shape interactions. The connection between the curves and these conclusions is not evident. The caption should be more specific and concise, directly tying the observed data to the claims.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references align with the figure's purported purpose but lack detailed explanation of how the figure demonstrates the stated phenomena. The references should provide more context or analysis to help the reader interpret the figure in relation to the claims."
