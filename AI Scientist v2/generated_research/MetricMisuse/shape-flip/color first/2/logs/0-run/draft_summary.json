  "Experiment_description": "The experiments involved transforming input sequences into chain-graphs, then training a lightweight GCN with two GCNConv layers, followed by global mean pooling and a linear classifier, to predict hidden labels using the SPR_BENCH dataset.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are important as they establish a baseline for using GCNs in sequence classification tasks. The insights gained into model performance, particularly in terms of accuracy and loss metrics, provide a foundation for further development and improvement of the model.",
  "Description": "Sequences were converted into chain-graphs with two-character tokens as nodes. These graphs were processed using GCNConv layers, followed by pooling and classification, with training on the SPR_BENCH dataset. Performance was evaluated using dual-weighted accuracy, and metrics were logged for reproducibility.",
