    "Summary": "The paper explores the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR), a symbolic reasoning task. The authors propose representing symbolic sequences as graphs and using GNNs to process these graphs, with different pooling strategies to aggregate node embeddings for classification. Experimental results show modest improvements over sequence-based baselines, but the analysis raises concerns about overfitting, scalability, and limited generalization.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The idea of applying GNNs to symbolic reasoning is an interesting direction, as GNNs can potentially capture relational information more effectively than sequence models.",
        "The paper examines different pooling strategies and highlights slight performance differences between them."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The contributions are incremental and lack novelty. Applying GNNs to symbolic tasks has already been explored in prior work, and the paper does not introduce a fundamentally new method or framework.",
        "The experimental results show only modest improvements over baselines, with no clear evidence of significant advancement in performance or practical utility.",
        "Overfitting and scalability issues are acknowledged but not addressed with any meaningful solutions or experiments to mitigate these problems.",
        "The choice of GNNs for this specific task is not justified convincingly. There is no discussion on why GNNs are better suited than sequence models or other alternatives.",
        "Ablation studies and analyses are superficial, failing to provide actionable insights or explain performance trends effectively.",
        "The clarity of the paper is lacking in several places, with vague descriptions of the methodology and insufficient details about experimental setups."

    "Questions": [
        "Why is a GNN-based approach specifically better suited for SPR compared to sequence-based models? Can the authors provide a theoretical justification or empirical evidence?",
        "How does the proposed method scale with larger and more complex datasets? Can the authors provide experiments or benchmarks for datasets with higher diversity or longer sequences?",
        "What mitigation strategies were considered for overfitting, and why were they not implemented in the experiments?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not address the scalability challenges of GNNs on larger datasets or graphs.",
        "Overfitting is a major issue acknowledged in the paper, but the experiments do not propose or evaluate any solutions to mitigate it.",
        "The analysis of pooling strategies is shallow and does not lead to actionable insights for model design or optimization."
