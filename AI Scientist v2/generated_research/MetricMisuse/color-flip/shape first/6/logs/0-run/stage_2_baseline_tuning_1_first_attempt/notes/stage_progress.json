  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Two-Phase Training Approach**: The use of a two-phase training approach\u2014initial self-supervised contrastive pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning\u2014proved to be effective. This approach consistently led to high shape-weighted and color-weighted accuracy, as well as low training and validation losses.\n\n- **Augmentation Invariance**: The Augmentation Invariance Score (AIS) was a valuable metric for assessing model robustness. Successful experiments maintained high AIS, indicating that the model predictions remained stable across augmented views.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic hyperparameter tuning, including variations in pre-training epochs, learning rates, and batch sizes, was crucial for optimizing performance. For instance, a moderate number of pre-training epochs (e.g., 3) and a balanced learning rate (e.g., 3e-4) yielded better results.\n\n- **Data Management and Experiment Tracking**: Storing all metrics, losses, and predictions in structured dictionaries and saving them for further analysis facilitated a comprehensive understanding of model performance and allowed for easy comparison across different experimental setups.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Overfitting with Excessive Pre-training**: Increasing the number of contrastive pre-training epochs beyond a certain point (e.g., 12 epochs) led to overfitting, as evidenced by increased training loss and decreased accuracy metrics.\n\n- **Learning Rate Extremes**: Very high learning rates (e.g., 1e-2) can destabilize training, leading to suboptimal performance. Similarly, very low learning rates can result in slow convergence.\n\n- **Batch Size Sensitivity**: While larger batch sizes can speed up training, they may also lead to less effective gradient updates, as seen with batch sizes of 256, which showed slightly lower AIS and accuracy metrics compared to smaller batch sizes.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Balanced Pre-training Epochs**: Maintain a moderate number of contrastive pre-training epochs (around 3-8) to prevent overfitting while still benefiting from self-supervised learning.\n\n- **Optimal Learning Rate**: Focus on learning rates in the range of 3e-4 to 1e-3 to ensure stable and efficient training. Avoid extremes that can lead to instability or slow convergence.\n\n- **Batch Size Considerations**: Experiment with batch sizes between 32 and 128 to find a balance between training speed and effective gradient updates. Monitor AIS and accuracy metrics to ensure robustness.\n\n- **Continued Use of AIS**: Continue to use the Augmentation Invariance Score as a key metric for evaluating model robustness and stability across augmented views.\n\n- **Comprehensive Experiment Tracking**: Maintain detailed records of all experimental setups, metrics, and results to facilitate future analysis and comparison. This practice will help identify successful patterns and avoid repeating past mistakes.\n\nBy adhering to these insights and recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes and avoid the pitfalls observed in the current set of experiments."
