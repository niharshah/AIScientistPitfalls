  "current_findings": "### Comprehensive Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Successful experiments consistently involved systematic hyperparameter tuning, such as adjusting learning rates, batch sizes, hidden dimensions, and contrastive temperatures. This approach allowed for fine-tuning model performance across various metrics, including Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), and Augmentation Invariance Score (AIS).\n\n- **Contrastive Pre-training and Supervised Fine-tuning**: The combination of contrastive pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning proved effective across multiple experiments. This two-phase training pipeline consistently improved model accuracy and reduced losses.\n\n- **Optimal Parameter Selection**: Experiments with a wide range of parameter values, such as contrastive temperatures and GRU hidden dimensions, demonstrated that certain configurations (e.g., lower temperatures and larger hidden dimensions) yielded better results, particularly in terms of SWA and CWA.\n\n- **Consistent Metric Improvement**: Across successful experiments, there was a consistent trend of metric improvement over epochs, indicating that the models were effectively learning and adapting to the training data.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Excessive Regularization**: The failed experiment with weight decay highlights the risk of excessive regularization. A weight decay value of 0.001 led to poor model performance, with metrics stagnating at low values. This suggests that overly aggressive regularization can hinder the model's ability to learn.\n\n- **Inadequate Parameter Ranges**: The failure to achieve optimal results in some configurations may be due to not exploring a wide enough range of hyperparameter values. For instance, the weight decay experiment could have benefited from testing smaller values.\n\n- **Lack of Adaptive Strategies**: Experiments that did not adaptively adjust hyperparameters based on intermediate results may miss opportunities for further optimization. Static parameter choices without feedback loops can lead to suboptimal performance.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Expand Hyperparameter Search Space**: Future experiments should consider expanding the range of hyperparameters, especially for those like weight decay, where excessive values led to failures. Testing smaller increments can help identify optimal settings.\n\n- **Implement Adaptive Tuning**: Incorporate adaptive tuning strategies that adjust hyperparameters based on real-time performance metrics. This approach can dynamically optimize the model during training.\n\n- **Focus on Successful Configurations**: Leverage insights from successful experiments, such as lower contrastive temperatures and larger hidden dimensions, to guide initial parameter settings in new experiments.\n\n- **Monitor Regularization Effects**: Pay close attention to the effects of regularization techniques like weight decay. Implement early stopping or regularization strength adjustments based on validation performance to prevent over-regularization.\n\n- **Comprehensive Error Analysis**: Conduct thorough error analysis for failed experiments to identify specific causes of poor performance. Use these insights to refine experimental designs and avoid repeating past mistakes.\n\nBy building on the successes and learning from the failures, future experiments can be better designed to achieve optimal model performance and robustness."
