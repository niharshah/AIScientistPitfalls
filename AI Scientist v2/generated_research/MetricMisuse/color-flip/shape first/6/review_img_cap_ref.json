        "Img_description": "The figure contains a placeholder text, 'example_failure_mode.png,' indicating that the actual illustration for misclassified examples (left) versus correct classifications (right) has not been included.",
        "Img_review": "The placeholder does not allow any analysis of the figure's quality, clarity, or alignment with the caption. The authors should replace this placeholder with the actual figure, ensuring it includes clear labels, legends, and meaningful comparisons between the transferred model and the baseline model.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption describes a comparison of misclassified and correctly classified examples between two models. However, without the actual figure, the accuracy and adequacy of the caption cannot be assessed. The authors should ensure it concisely conveys the figure's key takeaway.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The placeholder prevents evaluation of whether the main text references adequately describe the figure. Once the actual figure is provided, the authors should verify that the text provides sufficient context and explanation for the figure's content and relevance."
