% The paper 'Similarity-Guided Diffusion for Contrastive Sequential Recommendation' introduces a novel augmentation and denoising approach for contrastive learning, ensuring contextual and structural information is preserved. This is relevant for the proposed context-aware contrastive learning framework in symbolic sequence tasks, as it provides insights into generating effective positive and negative samples. It should be cited in the related work section to describe advancements in contrastive learning techniques.

% The paper 'Neurosymbolic AI: Bridging neural networks and symbolic reasoning' provides an in-depth discussion of the challenges and integration of symbolic reasoning systems with neural networks. It highlights the limitations of traditional symbolic reasoning, such as their dependence on labeled data and lack of generalization, which are critical to framing the research gap addressed by the proposed context-aware contrastive learning approach. This citation should be included in the related work section to contextualize the significance of combining symbolic reasoning with self-supervised learning techniques.
