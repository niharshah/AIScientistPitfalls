  "Experiment_description": "Experiments testing baseline models on SPR_BENCH data using GRU, Bi-GRU, and LSTM classifiers to assess Shape-Weighted Accuracy, Color-Weighted Accuracy, and Harmonic-Weighted Accuracy.",
  "Significance": "Establishing baseline metrics is crucial for future research, providing a benchmark for model refinement and highlighting key challenges such as overfitting and class imbalance.",
  "Description": "Nodes implemented different neural architectures to train on SPR_BENCH data, aiming for reproducible and stable baselines. GRU and Bi-GRU models were tested for generalization, while LSTM models were assessed for higher accuracy. Confusion matrices and class distribution plots were used to analyze model predictions and potential biases.",
