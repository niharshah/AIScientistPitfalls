    "figure_1": {
        "Img_description": "The image contains two subplots labeled (a) and (b) with placeholder text ('Baseline_Loss_Curves.png' and 'Baseline_HWA_Curves.png') in place of actual plots. Subplot (a) is captioned 'Loss curves over training epochs,' and subplot (b) is captioned 'Held-out accuracy plateaus early.'",
        "Img_review": "The figure currently lacks actual data and therefore fails to convey any meaningful information. To improve, the authors should include the actual plots, ensure clear axis labels and a legend (if necessary), and ensure the figure aligns with the caption's claims of overfitting.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption succinctly describes the figure's intended takeaway, stating that the baseline model quickly overfits with improvements in training loss not reflected in the held-out metric. However, without the actual data, it is unclear whether this claim is supported by the figure.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure appropriately by describing its intended content (training loss and held-out accuracy trends over epochs). However, without actual plots, the discussion cannot be substantiated or evaluated for accuracy."
    },
    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The figure is a placeholder image with the text 'Bidirectional_LSTM.png' and does not contain any visual representation of a bidirectional LSTM or any other graphical content.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is not a valid depiction of a bidirectional LSTM. It lacks any meaningful or scientific content to analyze. A proper diagram or visualization should replace this placeholder, including labeled components of the bidirectional LSTM architecture.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption, 'A bidirectional LSTM used in additional experiments,' is misleading as it implies the figure contains a visualization of a bidirectional LSTM, which is not the case. The caption should be revised to match the actual figure content once the placeholder is replaced.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure as visualizing a bidirectional LSTM, which is inconsistent with the placeholder image provided. The references need to be updated to align with the actual content of the figure when it is replaced with a proper visualization."
    },
    "figure_3": {
        "Img_description": "The figure appears to be blank or nearly blank, with no visible content, axes, labels, or graphical elements. It lacks any discernible depiction of 'context ablation' or related illustrations.",
        "Img_review": "The figure contains no meaningful information and fails to communicate any data or results. It lacks axes, labels, legends, and any graphical or textual content, making it non-informative. Significant improvements are needed to add relevant content, proper labeling, and clear visualization of the intended ablation study.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption, 'Context ablation illustrations,' is misleading as it implies that the figure contains visual representations or results of an ablation study, which it does not. The caption should be revised to either match the figure or reflect a concise takeaway.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references (figrefs) are missing, and there is no explanation of the figure's purpose or context in the manuscript. This omission prevents understanding of the figure's relevance or intended message. The text should include clear references and integration of the figure."
