    "Summary": "The paper proposes a context-aware contrastive learning framework for symbolic pattern recognition tasks, focusing on the Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) task. It employs symbolic-specific augmentations and denoising strategies to improve embeddings for symbolic sequences. Preliminary results show modest improvements over baseline metrics but highlight challenges in generating effective negative samples and handling symbolic diversity.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses an important challenge of adapting contrastive learning for symbolic reasoning tasks.",
        "Introduces symbolic-specific augmentations and denoising strategies to improve embeddings."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The contributions are incremental, with modest improvements over baselines (e.g., from 65.0% to slightly above 70.0% in CWA).",
        "Key challenges like constructing effective negative samples are noted but not adequately addressed in the methodology.",
        "The experimental setup lacks depth; for example, ablation studies are mentioned but results are deferred to supplementary material, leaving the main text lacking insights.",
        "The paper is unclear in describing implementation details for the proposed framework, such as how positive/negative pairs are generated systematically.",
        "Limited novelty in leveraging contrastive learning; much of the work adapts existing contrastive methods without fundamental innovations.",
        "The discussion of limitations and potential societal impacts is insufficient or absent. For example, how does this work generalize to real-world symbolic tasks beyond SPR?",
        "Reproducibility is hindered due to incomplete details on datasets, hyperparameters, and augmentations in the main content."

    "Questions": [
        "Can the authors provide more systematic ablation studies on augmentation types and negative sampling strategies?",

        "What steps are taken to ensure that the embeddings generalize beyond the SPR dataset?",
        "Could the authors clarify how symbolic diversity (shape/color complexity) is quantified and handled in the proposed framework?"

    "Limitations": [
        "The work does not adequately address how symbolic diversity, a key challenge, is handled robustly.",
        "The limited scope of evaluation (primarily on SPR BENCH) raises concerns about generalizability.",
        "The challenges in creating negative samples are noted but not addressed systematically in the proposed solution."
