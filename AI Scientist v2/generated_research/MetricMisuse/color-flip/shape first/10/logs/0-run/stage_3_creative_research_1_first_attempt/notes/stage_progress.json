  "current_findings": "### Comprehensive Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Embedding Dimension Tuning**: Increasing the embedding dimensions consistently improved model performance metrics such as shape-weighted accuracy (SWA), color-weighted accuracy (CWA), and harmonic-weighted accuracy (HWA). This suggests that larger embedding spaces allow the model to capture more complex patterns in the data.\n\n- **Contrastive Pre-training**: Implementing a SimCLR-style contrastive objective during pre-training was effective in learning robust embeddings. The use of context-aware augmentations like token masking and local shuffling helped maintain symbolic context while diversifying the training data.\n\n- **Fine-tuning with Cross-Entropy**: Attaching a linear classifier post pre-training and fine-tuning with cross-entropy loss on labeled data consistently improved validation metrics. This indicates that the initial contrastive learning phase provides a strong foundation for subsequent supervised learning.\n\n- **Synthetic Data Utilization**: The use of synthetic data when the real dataset was unavailable ensured that experiments could be executed without interruption. This approach maintained the self-contained nature of the scripts and allowed for consistent benchmarking.\n\n- **GPU Awareness and Efficiency**: All successful experiments were designed to be GPU-aware, ensuring efficient execution. The experiments were kept lightweight and completed within a reasonable time frame (<30 minutes), demonstrating efficient resource utilization.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Lack of Detailed Failure Data**: The absence of documented failed experiments makes it challenging to identify specific pitfalls. However, common issues in machine learning experiments typically include overfitting, inadequate data preprocessing, and improper hyperparameter settings.\n\n- **Over-reliance on Synthetic Data**: While synthetic data is useful, over-reliance on it can lead to models that do not generalize well to real-world data. Ensuring access to real datasets or enhancing the realism of synthetic data is crucial.\n\n- **Insufficient Validation**: Not evaluating models on a sufficiently diverse validation set can lead to overestimated performance metrics. Ensuring a robust validation process is essential for accurate performance assessment.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Explore Larger Embedding Dimensions**: Given the positive results with larger embedding dimensions, future experiments could explore even larger dimensions or dynamic embedding sizes that adapt based on input complexity.\n\n- **Enhance Contrastive Learning Techniques**: Experiment with different contrastive learning techniques or augmentations to further improve the quality of learned embeddings. Techniques like multi-view contrastive learning or incorporating domain-specific augmentations could be beneficial.\n\n- **Diversify Data Sources**: To mitigate the limitations of synthetic data, consider using data augmentation techniques to create more realistic synthetic datasets or collaborate with data providers to access real-world datasets.\n\n- **Implement Robust Validation Protocols**: Ensure that validation datasets are representative of the test conditions and include a variety of data scenarios to accurately gauge model performance.\n\n- **Document Failures**: Encourage detailed documentation of failed experiments to build a knowledge base of common pitfalls and areas for improvement. This will aid in refining experimental designs and avoiding repeated mistakes.\n\nBy leveraging these insights from successful experiments and addressing potential pitfalls, future experiments can be more effective and yield more reliable results."
