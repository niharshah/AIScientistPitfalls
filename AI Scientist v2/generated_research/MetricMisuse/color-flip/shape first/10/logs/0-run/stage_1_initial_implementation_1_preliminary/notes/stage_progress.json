  "current_findings": "### Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Simple Baseline Models**: Successful experiments consistently utilized simple baseline models, such as treating symbolic tokens as discrete vocabulary items and using basic neural network architectures (e.g., embedding layers followed by mean-pooling and linear classifiers). These models provided a solid foundation for further experimentation.\n\n- **Reproducibility and Consistency**: The successful experiments emphasized reproducibility by saving metrics, losses, predictions, and ground-truth labels in a standardized format (e.g., NumPy arrays) and adhering to consistent data-saving conventions.\n\n- **Effective Use of Resources**: Experiments efficiently utilized available resources, such as moving computations to the GPU when available, which contributed to their success. This ensured that the models ran efficiently and within a reasonable time frame.\n\n- **Metric Tracking**: Successful experiments consistently tracked key metrics, such as Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), and their harmonic mean (HWA), throughout the training process. This allowed for clear evaluation and comparison of model performance.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Module and File Path Issues**: A recurring issue in failed experiments was the inability to locate necessary modules or datasets due to incorrect file paths or missing files (e.g., 'SPR.py' or 'SPR_BENCH' dataset). This led to ModuleNotFoundError and FileNotFoundError.\n\n- **Dataset Availability**: Several failures were attributed to the absence of the required dataset in the expected directory, leading to errors during data loading. Even when fallback mechanisms for synthetic data were in place, they sometimes failed due to configuration issues.\n\n- **Attribute Naming Conflicts**: In one instance, an AttributeError was caused by a naming conflict between a custom class attribute and a pre-defined property in a library, highlighting the importance of careful attribute naming.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Ensure File and Module Availability**: Before running experiments, verify that all necessary files and modules are present in the correct directories. Consider dynamically adjusting the Python path or using environment variables to ensure that modules like 'SPR.py' can be imported successfully.\n\n- **Robust Dataset Handling**: Ensure that the dataset is correctly placed and accessible. If using synthetic data as a fallback, thoroughly test the data generation logic to avoid errors. Implement logging to provide clarity on data loading and synthetic data creation processes.\n\n- **Maintain Simplicity and Reproducibility**: Continue to build upon simple, reproducible baselines. This approach not only provides a clear reference point but also facilitates the integration of more complex techniques, such as context-aware contrastive pre-training, in future experiments.\n\n- **Attribute Naming Conventions**: Avoid naming conflicts by using unique and descriptive names for class attributes, especially when extending or interacting with existing libraries.\n\n- **Comprehensive Metric Tracking**: Maintain the practice of tracking and saving comprehensive metrics throughout the training process. This will aid in the evaluation of model performance and the identification of areas for improvement.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations and learning from both successful and failed experiments, future research can build more robust and efficient models, ultimately leading to improved performance and insights."
