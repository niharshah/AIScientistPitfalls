        "Caption_review": "The caption claims that 'some runs remain stable, while others show erratic dips with minor changes,' but without the actual figure, this cannot be verified. If the correct figure is provided, the caption should concisely summarize the key takeaway, ensuring it matches the visual content.",
        "Figrefs_review": "No references in the main text are provided (denoted by '[]'). The figure, when supplied, must be adequately explained and connected to the main text to clarify its purpose and relevance."

        "Img_description": "The image is a placeholder with the text 'baseline_finetune_loss.png' and does not contain any visual data or meaningful content for analysis.",
        "Img_review": "The actual figure is missing, making it impossible to evaluate its visual elements, clarity, or effectiveness. The placeholder should be replaced with the proper figure to allow for a detailed review.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption mentions 'Fine-tuning loss' and 'sudden fluctuations in apparently similar setups,' which suggests a graph or plot related to loss trends. Without the figure, it is unclear if the caption accurately represents the content. The caption could be concise but must align with the actual figure.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references to the figure are missing ('[]'). Proper references should be included to describe the figure's purpose, content, and relevance to the study."

        "Img_description": "The image is a placeholder with the text 'research_pretrain_loss.png' and does not display any graphical or scientific content.",
        "Img_review": "The actual figure is missing, replaced by a placeholder. This omission prevents analysis of the pre-training loss trends or evaluation of the figure's design (axes labeling, legends, readability, etc.). The figure needs to be included for proper analysis.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption ('Pre-training loss under research settings') is too generic and does not provide enough detail about the missing figure's content. It would benefit from a concise summary of the trends or key observations intended to be conveyed by the figure.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The references to Figure 3 in the main text provide context about what the figure was supposed to illustrate. However, without the figure, these references are incomplete and cannot fulfill their purpose of assisting the reader in interpreting the figure. They assume the figure is present and readable, which is not the case."
