% This paper introduces SimCLR, a foundational framework for contrastive learning of representations. It systematically studies the components of contrastive learning and demonstrates its effectiveness. This citation is relevant to provide theoretical background and justify the use of contrastive learning in the proposed context-aware framework for symbolic pattern recognition.

% This paper discusses the limitations of traditional symbolic reasoning methods, such as their reliance on structured rule-based frameworks and challenges with generalization and scalability. It provides a foundation for highlighting the research gap addressed in this work, particularly the need for approaches like context-aware contrastive learning to overcome these limitations. This citation will be used in the related work section to frame the challenges of symbolic reasoning.

% Paper 1 discusses advanced data augmentation techniques, focusing on maintaining semantic and structural consistency in contrastive learning, which is directly relevant to enhancing context-aware contrastive learning for symbolic sequences. Paper 3 introduces decomposition-based data augmentation methods, demonstrating their effectiveness in improving representation learning and downstream task performance. These papers will be cited to support the discussion on using advanced data augmentation and denoising techniques in the proposed framework for symbolic pattern recognition.
