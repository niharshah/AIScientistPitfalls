  "Experiment_description": "The experiments involve processing sequences using a Bi-GRU encoder with a SimCLR-style self-supervised learning approach. The models were fine-tuned using cross-entropy loss and evaluated using metrics like Shape-Weighted Accuracy and Color-Weighted Accuracy.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are significant as they demonstrate the efficacy of Bi-GRU encoders combined with contrastive learning for sequence representation tasks, achieving high accuracy and generalization. Insights from these experiments can guide further optimization in self-supervised learning methods.",
  "Description": "The experiments utilized the SPR_BENCH dataset, building a token-level vocabulary and encoding sequences with a Bi-GRU encoder. Models were pre-trained using augmented views and a SimCLR-style NT-Xent loss, followed by fine-tuning with a linear classifier. Metrics were stored and analyzed, with plots generated for visual insights.",
