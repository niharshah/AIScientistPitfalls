    "Summary": "The paper examines inconsistencies in deep learning models when deployed in real-world settings, focusing on training behaviors and unexpected instabilities during fine-tuning. The authors highlight issues such as training collapse and erratic behavior across different seeds and configurations, but do not offer any concrete methodological advancements or solutions.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The topic is relevant to the community, as real-world deployment challenges are a critical issue.",
        "The paper attempts to address an underexplored aspect of deep learning."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper lacks clear scientific contributions, as it primarily describes observed inconsistencies without providing novel insights, methods, or solutions.",
        "The methodology is vague and incomplete. Key details about the experimental setup, datasets used, and hyperparameters are missing.",
        "Figures and experimental results are insufficient and poorly explained, offering little value to support the claims.",
        "No strong connections are drawn to related work or theoretical underpinnings to explain the observed inconsistencies.",
        "The conclusions are weak and do not provide actionable guidance or meaningful contributions to the field.",
        "The writing lacks clarity and organization, making it difficult to follow the narrative or understand the significance of the findings."
