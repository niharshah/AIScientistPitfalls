Monitoring during this phase includes validation loss and the harmonic mean of SWA and CWA (HSCA). All computations are efficiently managed using a GPU, and results are meticulously logged and saved for further analysis.\n\nThe current plan builds on this baseline by introducing a hyperparameter tuning phase focused on optimizing the number of supervised fine-tuning epochs. The contrastive pre-training step remains unchanged, but the number of fine-tuning epochs is systematically varied among 5, 10, 15, and 20, with early stopping to prevent overfitting. This exploration aims to identify the optimal number of epochs that yield the best validation HSCA results. Each optimal checkpoint from the validation phase is then evaluated on a separate test set to ensure generalization. All metrics, including those from the hyperparameter sweeps, are logged and serialized for later plotting and analysis.\n\nOverall, the integration of these plans reflects a well-structured approach to refining the model's performance.

The training process was designed to improve representation learning by introducing two augmented views of each sequence and applying a contrastive loss (NT-Xent) alongside a standard cross-entropy loss. The overall objective was to enhance classification performance, measured by a Complexity-Weighted Composite Accuracy (CWCA), and provide a lightweight, efficient model that could run on a single GPU.

The major problem was an AttributeError in the build_synthetic() function, where a Python list of dictionaries was incorrectly passed to datasets.load_dataset. To resolve this, the current plan proposes re-implementing the synthetic data creation using datasets.Dataset.from_list and wrapping these in a DatasetDict, effectively preserving the data content while eliminating the error. Additionally, a minor bug related to an incorrect unpacking operation during model validation was identified and fixed.

The first stage involved a contrastive pre-training setup inspired by SimCLR, aimed at learning context-aware sequence embeddings from SPR sequences. This involved using random token-mask and deletion augmentations to generate augmented views of sequences and minimizing the NT-Xent loss. The encoder architecture consisted of an embedding layer followed by a single-layer GRU, with sequences tokenized at the symbol level and padded for batch processing. The second stage was a supervised fine-tuning process where a linear classifier was added to the encoder, and the model was further trained on labeled data. The validation process was carefully monitored using metrics such as SWA, CWA, and their harmonic mean (HSCA), with all computations being GPU-accelerated for efficiency. This plan laid a solid foundation for obtaining context-aware embeddings and performing effective classification.\n\nThe current plan builds upon this framework by focusing on hyperparameter tuning, specifically the `encoder_hidden_dim`. This involves iterating over different hidden dimensions (64, 128, 256, 512) for the encoder, contrastive head, and classifier. For each hidden dimension setting, the model undergoes the same two-stage training process, with evaluation after each supervised epoch on the development set, and final testing on a held-out split. Per-epoch losses, HSCA scores, predictions, and ground-truth labels are systematically recorded and stored. The key difference from the previous plan is the exploration of how varying the encoder hidden dimension impacts the model's performance, while the rest of the experimental pipeline remains unchanged.\n\nBy integrating these plans, the overall strategy involves not only establishing a baseline through a two-stage training process but also enhancing the model's performance through systematic hyperparameter tuning. This demonstrates a thoughtful progression from developing a foundational model to optimizing its performance parameters, ensuring both robustness and efficiency in the experimental setup.\n\nJSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"overall_plan\": \"The overall plan consists of a two-stage training process.

The goal is to establish a simple but fully working end-to-end pipeline that we can later replace with the proposed contrastive pre-training.\nAnalysis: \nNumerical Results: Metrics(training loss\u2193[SPR_BENCH:(final=0.5527, best=0.5527)]; validation loss\u2193[SPR_BENCH:(final=0.5693, best=0.5693)]; training HSCA\u2191[SPR_BENCH:(final=0.6782, best=0.6782)]; validation HSCA\u2191[SPR_BENCH:(final=0.6980, best=0.6980)])\nPlot Analyses:\n- Plot Path: experiments/2025-08-16_00-46-17_context_aware_contrastive_learning_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_b7baf3f5db534638925b545341930bb5_proc_3065841/SPR_BENCH_loss_curve.png, Description: The plot shows the training and validation loss over epochs. It indicates a consistent decrease in both training and validation loss, suggesting that the model is learning effectively without significant overfitting. The validation loss closely follows the training loss, which is a positive sign for generalization.\n- Plot Path: experiments/2025-08-16_00-46-17_context_aware_contrastive_learning_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_b7baf3f5db534638925b545341930bb5_proc_3065841/SPR_BENCH_hsca_curve.png, Description: This plot depicts the Harmonic Shape-Color Accuracy (HSCA) for both training and validation over epochs. The training HSCA shows slight fluctuations after an initial decrease, while the validation HSCA plateaus early. This could indicate that the model struggles to improve on the validation set despite further training, potentially due to limitations in the model's capacity or the dataset's complexity.\n- Plot Path: experiments/2025-08-16_00-46-17_context_aware_contrastive_learning_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_b7baf3f5db534638925b545341930bb5_proc_3065841/SPR_BENCH_confusion_matrix.png, Description: The confusion matrix at the last epoch provides insights into the model's prediction performance. It appears that the model has a bias towards one class, as indicated by the imbalanced distribution of predictions. This suggests a need for better handling of class imbalance or improvements in the model architecture to address this issue.\n\nNode ID: fb6897937f97456c82349c0c5eef43b8\nPlan: The overarching plan consists of a two-stage training process involving contrastive pre-training in a SimCLR-style manner, followed by supervised fine-tuning. The initial stage learns context-aware sequence embeddings using random token-mask and deletion augmentations to create diverse views of sequences. This is further enriched by minimizing NT-Xent loss for better distinguishing sequence differences. The process starts with symbol-level tokenization and sequences are processed via an Embedding layer and a 1-layer GRU to capture temporal and contextual information. Post pre-training, the encoder is copied and a linear classifier is appended for supervised fine-tuning, with validation loss and metrics like SWA, CWA, and HSCA monitored closely. The current 'Seed node' indicates a foundational stage for potential new experimentation, poised to either extend or refine the existing methodology.\nAnalysis: \nNumerical Results: Metrics(harmonic SCA\u2191[SPR_BENCH:(final=0.7870, best=0.8021)]; cross-entropy loss\u2193[SPR_BENCH:(final=0.5388, best=0.5388)])\nPlot Analyses:\n- Plot Path: experiments/2025-08-16_00-46-17_context_aware_contrastive_learning_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_fb6897937f97456c82349c0c5eef43b8_proc_3065838/SPR_BENCH_HSCA_curve.png, Description: The plot shows the Harmonic Shape-Weighted Accuracy (HSCA) increasing steadily over epochs during training. Starting from an initial value of approximately 0.6, the metric rises to 0.8 by the fifth epoch. This consistent improvement suggests that the model is learning effectively and becoming better at capturing the symbolic patterns in the SPR task. The upward trend is a positive indicator of the model's performance and the effectiveness of the proposed context-aware contrastive learning framework.\n- Plot Path: experiments/2025-08-16_00-46-17_context_aware_contrastive_learning_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_fb6897937f97456c82349c0c5eef43b8_proc_3065838/SPR_BENCH_loss_curve.png, Description: The plot illustrates the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss decreasing steadily over the training epochs. Beginning at approximately 0.68, the loss drops to around 0.54 by the fifth epoch. This decline in loss indicates that the model is converging and learning to make more accurate predictions. The consistent reduction in loss aligns with the increasing HSCA observed in the other plot, reinforcing the conclusion that the training process is progressing effectively and the model is improving.\n\nNode ID: faf3a123d2614806af34cbb29cbfc101\nPlan: The overall plan centers on building a robust baseline model through a two-stage process involving contrastive and supervised learning. The first stage employs a SimCLR-style contrastive pre-training to learn context-aware sequence embeddings from SPR sequences using random token-mask and deletion augmentations. Sequences are tokenized at the symbol level, passed through an embedding layer and a 1-layer GRU. Two augmented views of each sequence are created to minimize NT-Xent loss. After pre-training, the encoder is fine-tuned with a linear classifier on labeled data, monitoring validation loss along with SWA, CWA, and their harmonic mean (HSCA). This comprehensive approach ensures efficient resource utilization by leveraging GPU capabilities and structured data storage. The current plan, marked as a 'Seed node,' indicates the foundational stage, reaffirming the previous methodology without introducing new elements.\nAnalysis: The execution of the code was successful without any bugs. The results show a steady improvement during contrastive pre-training and supervised fine-tuning, achieving a final HSCA of 0.7927 on the test set, which surpasses the SOTA performance targets of 65.0% SWA and 70.0% CWA. The implementation is functionally correct and achieves the desired research goals.\nNumerical Results: Metrics(harmonic SCA\u2191[SPR_BENCH:(final=0.7927, best=0.8281)]; cross-entropy loss\u2193[SPR_BENCH:(final=0.5141, best=0.5141)])\nPlot Analyses:\n- Plot Path: experiments/2025-08-16_00-46-17_context_aware_contrastive_learning_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_faf3a123d2614806af34cbb29cbfc101_proc_3065840/SPR_BENCH_HSCA_curve.png, Description: This plot shows the progression of the Harmonic Shape-Weighted Accuracy (HSCA) over training epochs for the SPR_BENCH dataset. The HSCA starts at approximately 0.65, dips slightly at epoch 2, and then steadily increases, reaching over 0.825 by epoch 5. This trend suggests that the model's performance improves significantly with training, particularly after the third epoch. The initial dip might indicate the model's adjustment to the training data or the effects of early-stage regularization. The sharp improvement after epoch 3 could be attributed to the model effectively learning the symbolic patterns and leveraging the context-aware contrastive learning approach.\n- Plot Path: experiments/2025-08-16_00-46-17_context_aware_contrastive_learning_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_faf3a123d2614806af34cbb29cbfc101_proc_3065840/SPR_BENCH_loss_curve.png, Description: This plot depicts the cross-entropy loss over training epochs for the SPR_BENCH dataset. The loss decreases consistently from approximately 0.675 at epoch 1 to below 0.525 by epoch 5. This steady decline indicates that the model is learning effectively, with no signs of overfitting or stagnation during the observed epochs. The consistent reduction in loss aligns with the improvement in HSCA, suggesting that the training process is well-optimized and the context-aware contrastive learning framework is effective in minimizing errors.\n\nNode ID: 6b98d960d33c44309c0c879944f013ac\nPlan: The overall plan involves a two-stage approach to build a simple baseline for learning context-aware sequence embeddings. The first stage employs a SimCLR-style contrastive pre-training with random token-mask and deletion augmentations, creating two augmented views of each sequence and minimizing NT-Xent loss. This involves tokenizing sequences at the symbol level, padding them per batch, and processing through an embedding layer and a 1-layer GRU. The second stage involves supervised fine-tuning with a linear classifier added to the pre-trained encoder, monitoring validation loss and employing Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) and Cyclical Weight Averaging (CWA) to improve generalization, with their harmonic mean (HSCA) as an additional metric. The current plan, described as a 'Seed node,' does not add further changes, suggesting a focus on establishing or validating the foundational aspects of the methodology.\nAnalysis: \nNumerical Results: Metrics(harmonic SCA\u2191[SPR_BENCH:(final=0.7705, best=0.7705)]; cross-entropy loss\u2193[SPR_BENCH:(final=0.4764, best=0.4764)])\nPlot Analyses:\n- Plot Path: experiments/2025-08-16_00-46-17_context_aware_contrastive_learning_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_6b98d960d33c44309c0c879944f013ac_proc_3065841/SPR_BENCH_HSCA_curve.png, Description: The plot shows the Harmonic Shape-Color Accuracy (HSCA) increasing steadily over epochs during training. This indicates that the model is learning effectively and improving its ability to capture both shape and color-related patterns in the symbolic sequences. The curve stabilizes around epoch 4, suggesting that the model is nearing convergence and additional training may not yield significant improvement. Overall, the results are promising and demonstrate the potential of the context-aware contrastive learning framework for the SPR task.\n- Plot Path: experiments/2025-08-16_00-46-17_context_aware_contrastive_learning_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_6b98d960d33c44309c0c879944f013ac_proc_3065841/SPR_BENCH_loss_curve.png, Description: The plot depicts the training cross-entropy (CE) loss decreasing consistently over epochs. This downward trend confirms that the model is optimizing its parameters effectively and reducing the error in predictions over time. The smooth decrease without oscillations implies stable learning dynamics. By epoch 5, the loss is relatively low, further supporting the observation that the model is converging. These results align well with the improvement seen in the HSCA metric, reinforcing the effectiveness of the training process.\n\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nJSON:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, thoroughly reason as an expert researcher.

Contrastive Learning: Contrastive learning has shown substantial improvements in learning effective feature representations across various domains (Chen et al., 2020; He et al., 2020). Studies like Guo et al. (2021) and Li et al. (2023) demonstrate how contrastive learning can be enhanced with advanced data augmentation and denoising techniques, which can be adapted for symbolic sequences.\n2. Symbolic Reasoning: Traditional methods for symbolic reasoning often rely on extensive labeled data and struggle with generalization (Evans et al., 2018; Selsam et al., 2019). Incorporating contrastive learning can alleviate these issues by leveraging unlabeled data to learn more generalizable representations.\n3. SPR_BENCH Benchmark: The SPR_BENCH dataset provides a standardized benchmark for evaluating symbolic pattern recognition models. Current SOTA methods rely on supervised learning, achieving 65.0% SWA and 70.0% CWA, leaving room for improvement with innovative approaches.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis research proposes leveraging context-aware self-supervised contrastive learning to enhance feature representations for the Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) task. The SPR task involves classifying symbolic sequences governed by hidden logical rules, with significant potential for applications in automated reasoning systems. We hypothesize that context-aware contrastive learning, combined with advanced data augmentation and denoising techniques, can create more robust and generalizable embeddings of symbolic sequences. These embeddings can then be fine-tuned for the specific SPR task. We will design a context-aware contrastive learning framework tailored to the symbolic nature of the SPR_BENCH dataset and evaluate its performance using Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) and Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) metrics. The proposed approach aims to surpass the current SOTA performance of 65.0% SWA and 70.0% CWA, demonstrating the effectiveness of contrastive learning in symbolic pattern recognition.\n\n## Experiments\n\n1. Context-aware Contrastive Learning Framework Design:\n- Develop a context-aware contrastive learning framework tailored for symbolic sequences.\n- Incorporate advanced data augmentation techniques (e.g., token shuffling, token masking) and denoising strategies to create positive and negative pairs based on sequence similarity and dissimilarity in terms of shape and color complexity.\n\n2. Pre-training on Unlabeled Data:\n- Pre-train the model on unlabeled sequences from the SPR_BENCH dataset using the context-aware contrastive learning framework.\n- Evaluate the quality of learned embeddings using visualization techniques (e.g., t-SNE) and clustering metrics.\n\n3. Fine-tuning for SPR Task:\n- Fine-tune the pre-trained model on the labeled train split of the SPR_BENCH dataset.\n- Use the dev split for hyperparameter tuning and model selection.\n\n4. Evaluation:\n- Evaluate the model on the test split using the chosen metric (either SWA or CWA).\n- Compare the performance against the current SOTA.\n\n## Risk Factors And Limitations\n\n1. Complexity of Contrastive Learning: Designing effective positive and negative pairs for symbolic sequences may be challenging and could impact the quality of learned embeddings.\n2. Generalization: Although contrastive learning aims to improve generalization, there is a risk that the learned embeddings may not transfer well to the specific SPR task.\n3. Computational Resources: Pre-training a contrastive learning model on large symbolic sequences may require substantial computational resources, which could be a limitation for some academic labs.\n\n## Code To Potentially Use\n\nUse the following code as context for your experiments:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSPR.py\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nUtility to load the SPR_BENCH benchmark datasets\nUsing HuggingFace\u2019s `datasets` library.\n\nDirectory layout expected\nSPR_BENCH/\n \u251c\u2500 train.csv   (20000 rows)\n \u251c\u2500 dev.csv     (5000 rows)\n \u2514\u2500 test.csv    (10000 rows)\n\nEach CSV has header:  id,sequence,label\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n$ pip install datasets   # once\n\"\"\"\nimport pathlib\nfrom typing import Dict\n\nfrom datasets import load_dataset, DatasetDict                                         # <- no pandas import\n\n\ndef load_spr_bench(root: pathlib.Path) -> DatasetDict:\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a DatasetDict {'train':\u2026, 'dev':\u2026, 'test':\u2026} for one SPR ID folder.\n    \"\"\"\n    def _load(split_csv: str):\n        return load_dataset(\n            \"csv\",\n            data_files=str(root / split_csv),\n            split=\"train\",           # treat csv as a single split\n            cache_dir=\".cache_dsets\" # optional; keeps HF cache tidy\n        )\n\n    dset = DatasetDict()\n    dset[\"train\"] = _load(\"train.csv\")\n    dset[\"dev\"]   = _load(\"dev.csv\")\n    dset[\"test\"]  = _load(\"test.csv\")\n    return dset\n\n\ndef count_shape_variety(sequence: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Count the number of unique shape types in the sequence\"\"\"\n    return len(set(token[0] for token in sequence.strip().split() if token))\n\ndef count_color_variety(sequence: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Count the number of unique color types in the sequence\"\"\"\n    return len(set(token[1] for token in sequence.strip().split() if len(token) > 1))\n\ndef shape_weighted_accuracy(sequences, y_true, y_pred):\n    \"\"\"Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA)\"\"\"\n    weights = [count_shape_variety(seq) for seq in sequences]\n    correct = [w if yt == yp else 0 for w, yt, yp in zip(weights, y_true, y_pred)]\n    return sum(correct) / sum(weights) if sum(weights) > 0 else 0.0\n\ndef color_weighted_accuracy(sequences, y_true, y_pred):\n    \"\"\"Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA)\"\"\"\n    weights = [count_color_variety(seq) for seq in sequences]\n    correct = [w if yt == yp else 0 for w, yt, yp in zip(weights, y_true, y_pred)]\n    return sum(correct) / sum(weights) if sum(weights) > 0 else 0.0\n\n\ndef main():\n\n    ## Absolute path of the datasets\n    DATA_PATH = pathlib.Path('/home/zxl240011/AI-Scientist-v2/SPR_BENCH/')\n    spr_bench = load_spr_bench(DATA_PATH)\n\n    print(\"Benchmarks split:\", spr_bench.keys())\n\n    # Demo: show first example from SPR_BENCH\u2011train\n    ex = spr_bench[\"train\"][0]\n    print(\"\\nExample row:\")\n    print(ex)          \n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\n\n```\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- The aggregator script must load existing .npy experiment data from the \"exp_results_npy_files\" fields (ONLY using full and exact file paths in the summary JSONs) for thorough plotting.\n- It should call os.makedirs(\"figures\", exist_ok=True) before saving any plots.\n- Aim for a balance of empirical results, ablations, and diverse, informative visuals in 'figures/' that comprehensively showcase the finalized research outcomes.\n- If you need .npy paths from the summary, only copy those paths directly (rather than copying and parsing the entire summary).\n\nYour generated Python script must:\n1) Load or refer to relevant data and .npy files from these summaries.

The integrated approach combines the establishment of a sophisticated baseline with ablation studies to elucidate the roles of individual components in the model.\",\n      \"analysis\": \"\",\n      \"plot_code\": \"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nimport numpy as np\\nimport os\\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\\n\\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------\\nworking_dir = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \\\"working\\\")\\nos.makedirs(working_dir, exist_ok=True)\\n\\n# load experiment data\\ntry:\\n    experiment_data = np.load(\\n        os.path.join(working_dir, \\\"experiment_data.npy\\\"), allow_pickle=True\\n    ).item()\\nexcept Exception as e:\\n    print(f\\\"Error loading experiment data: {e}\\\")\\n    experiment_data = {}\\n\\n# iterate over model/dataset combinations\\nfor model_name, dsets in experiment_data.items():\\n    for dset_name, content in dsets.items():\\n        losses = content.get(\\\"losses\\\", {})\\n        metrics = content.get(\\\"metrics\\\", {})\\n        preds = content.get(\\\"predictions\\\", [])\\n        gts = content.get(\\\"ground_truth\\\", [])\\n\\n        # 1) train/val loss curve -------------------------------------------------\\n        try:\\n            train_loss = losses.get(\\\"train\\\", [])\\n            val_loss = losses.get(\\\"val\\\", [])\\n            if train_loss and val_loss:\\n                plt.figure()\\n                epochs = range(1, len(train_loss) + 1)\\n                plt.plot(epochs, train_loss, label=\\\"Train\\\")\\n                plt.plot(epochs, val_loss, label=\\\"Validation\\\")\\n                plt.xlabel(\\\"Epoch\\\")\\n                plt.ylabel(\\\"Cross-Entropy Loss\\\")\\n                plt.title(f\\\"{dset_name} - {model_name} - Loss Curve\\\")\\n                plt.legend()\\n                fname = f\\\"{dset_name}_{model_name}_loss_curve.png\\\".replace(\\\" \\\", \\\"_\\\")\\n                plt.savefig(os.path.join(working_dir, fname))\\n            plt.close()\\n        except Exception as e:\\n            print(f\\\"Error creating loss curve: {e}\\\")\\n            plt.close()\\n\\n        # 2) train/val CWCA curve -------------------------------------------------\\n        try:\\n            train_cwca = metrics.get(\\\"train\\\", [])\\n            val_cwca = metrics.get(\\\"val\\\", [])\\n            if train_cwca and val_cwca:\\n                plt.figure()\\n                epochs = range(1, len(train_cwca) + 1)\\n                plt.plot(epochs, train_cwca, label=\\\"Train\\\")\\n                plt.plot(epochs, val_cwca, label=\\\"Validation\\\")\\n                plt.xlabel(\\\"Epoch\\\")\\n                plt.ylabel(\\\"CWCA\\\")\\n                plt.title(f\\\"{dset_name} - {model_name} - CWCA Curve\\\")\\n                plt.legend()\\n                fname = f\\\"{dset_name}_{model_name}_cwca_curve.png\\\".replace(\\\" \\\", \\\"_\\\")\\n                plt.savefig(os.path.join(working_dir, fname))\\n            plt.close()\\n        except Exception as e:\\n            print(f\\\"Error creating CWCA curve: {e}\\\")\\n            plt.close()\\n\\n        # 3) confusion matrix on test set ----------------------------------------\\n        try:\\n            if preds and gts:\\n                cm = confusion_matrix(gts, preds)\\n                plt.figure()\\n                im = plt.imshow(cm, cmap=\\\"Blues\\\")\\n                plt.colorbar(im, fraction=0.046, pad=0.04)\\n                plt.xlabel(\\\"Predicted label\\\")\\n                plt.ylabel(\\\"True label\\\")\\n                plt.title(f\\\"{dset_name} - {model_name} - Confusion Matrix (Test Set)\\\")\\n                for (i, j), v in np.ndenumerate(cm):\\n                    plt.text(j, i, str(v), ha=\\\"center\\\", va=\\\"center\\\", color=\\\"black\\\")\\n                fname = f\\\"{dset_name}_{model_name}_confusion_matrix.png\\\".replace(\\n                    \\\" \\\", \\\"_\\\"\\n                )\\n                plt.savefig(os.path.join(working_dir, fname))\\n            plt.close()\\n        except Exception as e:\\n            print(f\\\"Error creating confusion matrix: {e}\\\")\\n            plt.close()\\n\\n        # print evaluation metric -------------------------------------------------\\n        try:\\n            test_cwca = metrics.get(\\\"test\\\", [None])[0]\\n            print(f\\\"{model_name} on {dset_name} - Test CWCA: {test_cwca}\\\")\\n        except Exception as e:\\n            print(f\\\"Error printing test CWCA: {e}\\\")\\n\",\n      \"plot_plan\": \"The script will load the stored experiment_data.npy, iterate over the available model\\u2013dataset pair(s), and, if data exist, generate up-to-five standard diagnostic plots: (1) train/val loss curve, (2) train/val CWCA curve, and (3) a test-set confusion matrix built from the recorded predictions vs. ground-truth labels.

Contrastive Learning: Contrastive learning has shown substantial improvements in learning effective feature representations across various domains (Chen et al., 2020; He et al., 2020). Studies like Guo et al. (2021) and Li et al. (2023) demonstrate how contrastive learning can be enhanced with advanced data augmentation and denoising techniques, which can be adapted for symbolic sequences.\n2. Symbolic Reasoning: Traditional methods for symbolic reasoning often rely on extensive labeled data and struggle with generalization (Evans et al., 2018; Selsam et al., 2019). Incorporating contrastive learning can alleviate these issues by leveraging unlabeled data to learn more generalizable representations.\n3. SPR_BENCH Benchmark: The SPR_BENCH dataset provides a standardized benchmark for evaluating symbolic pattern recognition models. Current SOTA methods rely on supervised learning, achieving 65.0% SWA and 70.0% CWA, leaving room for improvement with innovative approaches.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis research proposes leveraging context-aware self-supervised contrastive learning to enhance feature representations for the Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) task. The SPR task involves classifying symbolic sequences governed by hidden logical rules, with significant potential for applications in automated reasoning systems. We hypothesize that context-aware contrastive learning, combined with advanced data augmentation and denoising techniques, can create more robust and generalizable embeddings of symbolic sequences. These embeddings can then be fine-tuned for the specific SPR task. We will design a context-aware contrastive learning framework tailored to the symbolic nature of the SPR_BENCH dataset and evaluate its performance using Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) and Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) metrics. The proposed approach aims to surpass the current SOTA performance of 65.0% SWA and 70.0% CWA, demonstrating the effectiveness of contrastive learning in symbolic pattern recognition.\n\n## Experiments\n\n1. Context-aware Contrastive Learning Framework Design:\n- Develop a context-aware contrastive learning framework tailored for symbolic sequences.\n- Incorporate advanced data augmentation techniques (e.g., token shuffling, token masking) and denoising strategies to create positive and negative pairs based on sequence similarity and dissimilarity in terms of shape and color complexity.\n\n2. Pre-training on Unlabeled Data:\n- Pre-train the model on unlabeled sequences from the SPR_BENCH dataset using the context-aware contrastive learning framework.\n- Evaluate the quality of learned embeddings using visualization techniques (e.g., t-SNE) and clustering metrics.\n\n3. Fine-tuning for SPR Task:\n- Fine-tune the pre-trained model on the labeled train split of the SPR_BENCH dataset.\n- Use the dev split for hyperparameter tuning and model selection.\n\n4. Evaluation:\n- Evaluate the model on the test split using the chosen metric (either SWA or CWA).\n- Compare the performance against the current SOTA.\n\n## Risk Factors And Limitations\n\n1. Complexity of Contrastive Learning: Designing effective positive and negative pairs for symbolic sequences may be challenging and could impact the quality of learned embeddings.\n2. Generalization: Although contrastive learning aims to improve generalization, there is a risk that the learned embeddings may not transfer well to the specific SPR task.\n3. Computational Resources: Pre-training a contrastive learning model on large symbolic sequences may require substantial computational resources, which could be a limitation for some academic labs.\n\n## Code To Potentially Use\n\nUse the following code as context for your experiments:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSPR.py\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nUtility to load the SPR_BENCH benchmark datasets\nUsing HuggingFace\u2019s `datasets` library.\n\nDirectory layout expected\nSPR_BENCH/\n \u251c\u2500 train.csv   (20000 rows)\n \u251c\u2500 dev.csv     (5000 rows)\n \u2514\u2500 test.csv    (10000 rows)\n\nEach CSV has header:  id,sequence,label\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n$ pip install datasets   # once\n\"\"\"\nimport pathlib\nfrom typing import Dict\n\nfrom datasets import load_dataset, DatasetDict                                         # <- no pandas import\n\n\ndef load_spr_bench(root: pathlib.Path) -> DatasetDict:\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a DatasetDict {'train':\u2026, 'dev':\u2026, 'test':\u2026} for one SPR ID folder.\n    \"\"\"\n    def _load(split_csv: str):\n        return load_dataset(\n            \"csv\",\n            data_files=str(root / split_csv),\n            split=\"train\",           # treat csv as a single split\n            cache_dir=\".cache_dsets\" # optional; keeps HF cache tidy\n        )\n\n    dset = DatasetDict()\n    dset[\"train\"] = _load(\"train.csv\")\n    dset[\"dev\"]   = _load(\"dev.csv\")\n    dset[\"test\"]  = _load(\"test.csv\")\n    return dset\n\n\ndef count_shape_variety(sequence: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Count the number of unique shape types in the sequence\"\"\"\n    return len(set(token[0] for token in sequence.strip().split() if token))\n\ndef count_color_variety(sequence: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Count the number of unique color types in the sequence\"\"\"\n    return len(set(token[1] for token in sequence.strip().split() if len(token) > 1))\n\ndef shape_weighted_accuracy(sequences, y_true, y_pred):\n    \"\"\"Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA)\"\"\"\n    weights = [count_shape_variety(seq) for seq in sequences]\n    correct = [w if yt == yp else 0 for w, yt, yp in zip(weights, y_true, y_pred)]\n    return sum(correct) / sum(weights) if sum(weights) > 0 else 0.0\n\ndef color_weighted_accuracy(sequences, y_true, y_pred):\n    \"\"\"Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA)\"\"\"\n    weights = [count_color_variety(seq) for seq in sequences]\n    correct = [w if yt == yp else 0 for w, yt, yp in zip(weights, y_true, y_pred)]\n    return sum(correct) / sum(weights) if sum(weights) > 0 else 0.0\n\n\ndef main():\n\n    ## Absolute path of the datasets\n    DATA_PATH = pathlib.Path('/home/zxl240011/AI-Scientist-v2/SPR_BENCH/')\n    spr_bench = load_spr_bench(DATA_PATH)\n\n    print(\"Benchmarks split:\", spr_bench.keys())\n\n    # Demo: show first example from SPR_BENCH\u2011train\n    ex = spr_bench[\"train\"][0]\n    print(\"\\nExample row:\")\n    print(ex)          \n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\n\n```\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- The aggregator script must load existing .npy experiment data from the \"exp_results_npy_files\" fields (ONLY using full and exact file paths in the summary JSONs) for thorough plotting.\n- It should call os.makedirs(\"figures\", exist_ok=True) before saving any plots.\n- Aim for a balance of empirical results, ablations, and diverse, informative visuals in 'figures/' that comprehensively showcase the finalized research outcomes.\n- If you need .npy paths from the summary, only copy those paths directly (rather than copying and parsing the entire summary).\n\nYour generated Python script must:\n1) Load or refer to relevant data and .npy files from these summaries.

The integrated approach combines the establishment of a sophisticated baseline with ablation studies to elucidate the roles of individual components in the model.\",\n      \"analysis\": \"\",\n      \"plot_code\": \"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nimport numpy as np\\nimport os\\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\\n\\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------\\nworking_dir = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \\\"working\\\")\\nos.makedirs(working_dir, exist_ok=True)\\n\\n# load experiment data\\ntry:\\n    experiment_data = np.load(\\n        os.path.join(working_dir, \\\"experiment_data.npy\\\"), allow_pickle=True\\n    ).item()\\nexcept Exception as e:\\n    print(f\\\"Error loading experiment data: {e}\\\")\\n    experiment_data = {}\\n\\n# iterate over model/dataset combinations\\nfor model_name, dsets in experiment_data.items():\\n    for dset_name, content in dsets.items():\\n        losses = content.get(\\\"losses\\\", {})\\n        metrics = content.get(\\\"metrics\\\", {})\\n        preds = content.get(\\\"predictions\\\", [])\\n        gts = content.get(\\\"ground_truth\\\", [])\\n\\n        # 1) train/val loss curve -------------------------------------------------\\n        try:\\n            train_loss = losses.get(\\\"train\\\", [])\\n            val_loss = losses.get(\\\"val\\\", [])\\n            if train_loss and val_loss:\\n                plt.figure()\\n                epochs = range(1, len(train_loss) + 1)\\n                plt.plot(epochs, train_loss, label=\\\"Train\\\")\\n                plt.plot(epochs, val_loss, label=\\\"Validation\\\")\\n                plt.xlabel(\\\"Epoch\\\")\\n                plt.ylabel(\\\"Cross-Entropy Loss\\\")\\n                plt.title(f\\\"{dset_name} - {model_name} - Loss Curve\\\")\\n                plt.legend()\\n                fname = f\\\"{dset_name}_{model_name}_loss_curve.png\\\".replace(\\\" \\\", \\\"_\\\")\\n                plt.savefig(os.path.join(working_dir, fname))\\n            plt.close()\\n        except Exception as e:\\n            print(f\\\"Error creating loss curve: {e}\\\")\\n            plt.close()\\n\\n        # 2) train/val CWCA curve -------------------------------------------------\\n        try:\\n            train_cwca = metrics.get(\\\"train\\\", [])\\n            val_cwca = metrics.get(\\\"val\\\", [])\\n            if train_cwca and val_cwca:\\n                plt.figure()\\n                epochs = range(1, len(train_cwca) + 1)\\n                plt.plot(epochs, train_cwca, label=\\\"Train\\\")\\n                plt.plot(epochs, val_cwca, label=\\\"Validation\\\")\\n                plt.xlabel(\\\"Epoch\\\")\\n                plt.ylabel(\\\"CWCA\\\")\\n                plt.title(f\\\"{dset_name} - {model_name} - CWCA Curve\\\")\\n                plt.legend()\\n                fname = f\\\"{dset_name}_{model_name}_cwca_curve.png\\\".replace(\\\" \\\", \\\"_\\\")\\n                plt.savefig(os.path.join(working_dir, fname))\\n            plt.close()\\n        except Exception as e:\\n            print(f\\\"Error creating CWCA curve: {e}\\\")\\n            plt.close()\\n\\n        # 3) confusion matrix on test set ----------------------------------------\\n        try:\\n            if preds and gts:\\n                cm = confusion_matrix(gts, preds)\\n                plt.figure()\\n                im = plt.imshow(cm, cmap=\\\"Blues\\\")\\n                plt.colorbar(im, fraction=0.046, pad=0.04)\\n                plt.xlabel(\\\"Predicted label\\\")\\n                plt.ylabel(\\\"True label\\\")\\n                plt.title(f\\\"{dset_name} - {model_name} - Confusion Matrix (Test Set)\\\")\\n                for (i, j), v in np.ndenumerate(cm):\\n                    plt.text(j, i, str(v), ha=\\\"center\\\", va=\\\"center\\\", color=\\\"black\\\")\\n                fname = f\\\"{dset_name}_{model_name}_confusion_matrix.png\\\".replace(\\n                    \\\" \\\", \\\"_\\\"\\n                )\\n                plt.savefig(os.path.join(working_dir, fname))\\n            plt.close()\\n        except Exception as e:\\n            print(f\\\"Error creating confusion matrix: {e}\\\")\\n            plt.close()\\n\\n        # print evaluation metric -------------------------------------------------\\n        try:\\n            test_cwca = metrics.get(\\\"test\\\", [None])[0]\\n            print(f\\\"{model_name} on {dset_name} - Test CWCA: {test_cwca}\\\")\\n        except Exception as e:\\n            print(f\\\"Error printing test CWCA: {e}\\\")\\n\",\n      \"plot_plan\": \"The script will load the stored experiment_data.npy, iterate over the available model\\u2013dataset pair(s), and, if data exist, generate up-to-five standard diagnostic plots: (1) train/val loss curve, (2) train/val CWCA curve, and (3) a test-set confusion matrix built from the recorded predictions vs. ground-truth labels.
