        "Img_description": "The figure contains only placeholder text reading 'example_baseline.pdf' and does not display any actual graphical or textual data. There are no axes, labels, or data points visible in the figure.",
        "Img_review": "The figure appears to be a placeholder or improperly rendered, as it contains no meaningful content or graphical elements. This is a critical issue, as it prevents any meaningful analysis or interpretation of the figure. The authors should ensure that the actual figure is correctly embedded, showing the relevant data (e.g., baseline performance metrics and symbolic consistency).",
        "Caption_review": "The caption describes baseline performance and mentions hidden symbolic consistency accuracy (HSCA), but since the figure is not rendered correctly, it is impossible to verify whether the caption matches the figure. If the figure were properly presented, the caption should concisely summarize the key takeaway. In its current state, the caption cannot be evaluated for alignment.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure, stating that it exemplifies how standard accuracy can be misleading and provides information about HSCA. However, due to the lack of content in the figure, it is impossible to confirm whether the references are accurate or meaningful. The authors must ensure that the figure is properly included to allow for a complete review of its alignment with the text."

        "Caption_review": "The caption describes an 'extended confusion matrix' showing a 'marked increase in misclassifications,' but no such figure is provided. The caption cannot be assessed for accuracy against the nonexistent figure. Once the correct figure is included, the caption should be reviewed for relevance and conciseness.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references are missing ([]), providing no context or explanation for the figure. This should be addressed by including detailed references in the main text that explain the figure's content, context, and purpose."
