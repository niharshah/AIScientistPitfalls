  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Successful experiments often involved careful hyperparameter tuning, such as adjusting the number of supervised fine-tuning epochs with early stopping. This approach helped in selecting the best model checkpoints based on validation performance, leading to improved test results.\n\n- **Transformer Encoders:** Replacing GRU encoders with lightweight Transformer encoders consistently led to better performance. The inclusion of positional embeddings and complexity-aware contrastive pre-training further enhanced the model's ability to capture global context and handle complex data.\n\n- **Complexity-Aware Training:** Incorporating symbolic complexity into the training process, such as weighting the InfoNCE loss by each sample\u2019s complexity, improved the model's ability to generalize. This was evident in the improved Complexity-Weighted Accuracy (CompWA) metrics.\n\n- **Rich Augmentations:** Successful experiments utilized richer data augmentations, such as masking and local shuffling, which helped in creating more robust models. These augmentations encouraged the model to focus on rule-level semantics rather than surface-level features.\n\n- **Efficient Training:** The ability to run experiments end-to-end in under 30 minutes on CPU/GPU was a common feature of successful designs. This efficiency was often achieved by falling back to synthetic datasets when necessary, ensuring that the experiments could be conducted in a resource-constrained environment.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Tensor Dimension Mismatches:** A recurring issue in failed experiments was mismatches in tensor dimensions during loss computations, particularly in the NT-Xent loss function. This often resulted from incorrect slicing or concatenation of tensors.\n\n- **Zero-Dimensional Tensor Concatenation:** Another common pitfall was attempting to concatenate zero-dimensional tensors, which is not allowed. This issue arose in the nt_xent function and required careful handling of tensor dimensions before concatenation.\n\n- **Inadequate Debugging:** The lack of sufficient debugging information made it difficult to diagnose issues quickly. Failed experiments often lacked detailed print statements or checks to verify tensor shapes, leading to runtime errors that could have been avoided with more thorough debugging practices.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Hyperparameter Tuning:** Continue to explore different hyperparameter configurations, especially for fine-tuning epochs and early stopping criteria. Consider automating this process to efficiently explore a larger hyperparameter space.\n\n- **Focus on Transformer Architectures:** Given the success of Transformer encoders, future experiments should prioritize exploring different Transformer architectures and configurations, including varying the number of heads and layers.\n\n- **Improve Complexity Handling:** Further refine the complexity-aware training approach by experimenting with different ways to quantify and incorporate complexity into the loss function. This could involve exploring alternative complexity metrics or weighting schemes.\n\n- **Robust Data Augmentations:** Expand the use of data augmentations to include additional techniques that can further challenge the model and improve its robustness. Consider augmentations that simulate real-world noise and variability.\n\n- **Thorough Debugging Practices:** Implement comprehensive debugging practices, including detailed logging of tensor shapes and intermediate computations. This will help quickly identify and resolve issues related to tensor operations.\n\n- **Resource Efficiency:** Maintain a focus on resource-efficient designs that can run quickly on limited hardware. This includes optimizing code for both CPU and GPU execution and ensuring fallback mechanisms are in place for synthetic datasets.\n\nBy leveraging these insights, future experiments can build on the successes and avoid the pitfalls identified, leading to more robust and effective models."
