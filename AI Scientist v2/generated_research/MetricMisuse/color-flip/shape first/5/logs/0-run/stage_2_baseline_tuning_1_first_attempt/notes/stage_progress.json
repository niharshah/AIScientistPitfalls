  "current_findings": "## Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Contrastive Pre-training**: A consistent pattern of success was observed with the use of contrastive pre-training, specifically using the SimCLR-style approach. This method effectively learns context-aware sequence embeddings, which enhances the performance during the supervised fine-tuning stage.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic hyperparameter tuning, including learning rates, batch sizes, and contrastive temperatures, significantly improved model performance. For instance, grid-search over learning rates and batch sizes yielded optimal settings that enhanced harmonic shape-color accuracy (HSCA).\n\n- **Epoch Sweeping**: Sweeping the number of supervised fine-tuning epochs with early stopping allowed models to achieve higher HSCA scores. The best validation checkpoints were retained for evaluation on test sets, ensuring robust performance.\n\n- **Model Architecture Adjustments**: Adjustments to model architecture, such as varying encoder hidden dimensions and embedding sizes, contributed to improved performance. Larger hidden dimensions generally resulted in better HSCA scores.\n\n- **Data Handling and Augmentation**: Effective data handling, including tokenization and augmentation strategies like random token-mask/deletion, played a crucial role in the success of the experiments.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Suboptimal Hyperparameter Settings**: Experiments with non-ideal hyperparameter settings, such as inappropriate learning rates or batch sizes, resulted in lower performance. For example, larger batch sizes (e.g., 512) led to decreased HSCA scores.\n\n- **Inadequate Pre-training Epochs**: Insufficient contrastive pre-training epochs negatively impacted the model's ability to learn robust embeddings, leading to lower test set performance.\n\n- **Overfitting**: Without proper regularization techniques, models tended to overfit, especially when fine-tuning for too many epochs without early stopping.\n\n- **Inconsistent Data Augmentation**: Inconsistent or inadequate data augmentation strategies could lead to models that are not robust to variations in input data.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Optimize Contrastive Pre-training**: Continue leveraging contrastive pre-training with careful tuning of the number of epochs and temperature parameters. Experiment with different augmentation strategies to further enhance embedding quality.\n\n- **Systematic Hyperparameter Exploration**: Implement comprehensive grid-search or Bayesian optimization for hyperparameters like learning rates, batch sizes, and weight decay to find optimal configurations.\n\n- **Regularization Techniques**: Incorporate regularization techniques such as dropout or weight decay to prevent overfitting, especially during the fine-tuning phase.\n\n- **Adaptive Epoch Management**: Use adaptive strategies for managing the number of training epochs, such as early stopping based on validation performance, to avoid overfitting and ensure efficient training.\n\n- **Robust Data Augmentation**: Develop robust data augmentation pipelines that can handle various input variations, ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n\nBy focusing on these strategies, future experiments can build on the successes observed while mitigating common pitfalls, leading to more robust and effective models."
