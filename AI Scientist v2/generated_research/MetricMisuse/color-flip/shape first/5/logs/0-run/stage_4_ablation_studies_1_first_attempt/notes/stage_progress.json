  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Contrastive Pre-training**: Successful experiments consistently utilized a contrastive pre-training phase that improved downstream task performance. The use of a projection head during this phase was crucial, as it allowed the encoder to focus on learning pairwise similarities without affecting class-separable structures.\n\n- **Encoder Architecture**: The bi-directional LSTM encoder, when combined with a contrastive pre-training phase, showed better performance compared to simpler architectures like Bag-of-Tokens. This indicates the importance of capturing sequential dependencies in the data.\n\n- **Metric Tracking and Evaluation**: Successful experiments tracked multiple metrics, including Shape-Weighted Accuracy, Color-Weighted Accuracy, and Augmentation Consistency Rate (ACR), which provided a comprehensive view of model performance.\n\n- **Bug Fixes and Implementation Corrections**: Addressing bugs, such as incorrect positive-pair indexing and normalization issues in the NT-Xent loss, led to significant improvements in model performance.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Dataset and Module Accessibility**: Several failed experiments were due to the inability to load the real SPR_BENCH dataset, defaulting to synthetic data. This highlights the importance of ensuring all necessary datasets and modules are accessible and correctly set up.\n\n- **Contrastive Loss Implementation**: Incorrect implementations of the NT-Xent loss, such as retaining positive-pair similarity in the denominator, led to non-converging loss values. Proper implementation of the loss function is critical for effective contrastive learning.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: High temperature parameters in the NT-Xent loss and suboptimal learning rates were common issues that hindered model convergence and representation learning.\n\n- **Freezing Encoder Parameters**: Experiments that froze encoder parameters during fine-tuning often resulted in poor performance, indicating the need for flexibility in updating encoder weights during supervised training.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Ensure Dataset and Module Setup**: Before running experiments, verify that all datasets and modules are correctly installed and accessible. This will prevent fallback to synthetic data and ensure experiments are conducted on the intended datasets.\n\n- **Utilize Projection Heads in Contrastive Learning**: Incorporate a projection head during the contrastive pre-training phase to prevent the encoder from focusing solely on pairwise similarities, which can negatively impact downstream task performance.\n\n- **Optimize Hyperparameters**: Experiment with different temperature parameters, learning rates, and augmentation strategies to enhance contrastive learning. Monitoring gradient values can also help identify issues like vanishing or exploding gradients.\n\n- **Allow Encoder Fine-tuning**: Consider allowing partial or full fine-tuning of encoder parameters during the supervised training phase to improve model performance. Evaluate the quality of frozen representations before deciding to freeze encoder weights.\n\n- **Comprehensive Metric Tracking**: Continue tracking a variety of metrics, including ACR, to gain insights into model performance across different aspects. Analyze t-SNE visualizations to assess the quality of learned embeddings.\n\nBy incorporating these insights and recommendations, future experiments can build on past successes while avoiding common pitfalls, leading to more robust and effective models."
