    "Summary": "The paper discusses challenges faced by deep learning models in symbolic reasoning tasks, focusing on inconclusive and negative results. It highlights how standard training regimes struggle with symbolic data under distributional shifts and proposes a need for re-evaluating symbolic constraints in learning setups.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper tackles the important issue of evaluating symbolic reasoning tasks, an area that is less explored compared to other domains like vision and language.",
        "The focus on negative results can be valuable if framed constructively to guide improvements in the field."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The contributions of the paper are limited to negative results without proposing new solutions or methodologies to address the identified shortcomings.",
        "The analysis provided is shallow and lacks depth, with key findings not thoroughly explained or contextualized against prior work.",
        "The experiments are not well-documented, and crucial details such as datasets, hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics are only briefly mentioned or relegated to the appendix.",
        "No novel dataset, benchmark, or methodology is introduced to substantiate the claims or provide a useful resource for future research.",
        "The paper lacks actionable insights or concrete recommendations for improving symbolic reasoning in deep learning models.",
        "Figures (e.g., Figure 1 and Figure 2) are referenced but do not provide sufficient information or clarity to support the claims made in the text."
