    "Summary": "The paper identifies pitfalls in deploying deep learning models in real-world settings, focusing on inconsistent performance and inconclusive results from refinements. It reports negative results from experiments with an image classification model applied to slightly shifted domains. However, the paper lacks depth, rigor, and actionable insights.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The topic of pitfalls and challenges in real-world deep learning deployments is important and underexplored."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The methodology is poorly described, with critical details about datasets, architectures, and refinements omitted.",
        "The experiments lack rigor and fail to lead to actionable insights or a deeper understanding of the identified pitfalls.",
        "The paper does not propose any novel methods or frameworks to address the challenges.",
        "The writing is unclear and incomplete, with placeholders for references and insufficient discussion of related work.",
        "The results are trivial and do not advance the state of the art in understanding or solving real-world deployment issues."

    "Questions": [
        "What are the specific details of the dataset used in the experiments? How does it differ from the original benchmark?",

        "What is the rationale for the specific refinements (e.g., normalization layers) applied to the model?",
        "How were the shifts in the test distributions generated or defined?",
        "Why were only six seeds and three shifted distributions tested? Is this sufficient for meaningful conclusions?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not adequately discuss the limitations of its experimental setup or the scope of its findings.",
        "Potential ethical considerations or societal impacts of the work are not addressed."
