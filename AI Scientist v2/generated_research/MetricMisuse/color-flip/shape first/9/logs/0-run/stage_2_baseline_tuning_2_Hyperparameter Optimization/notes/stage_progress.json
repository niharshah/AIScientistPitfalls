Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: A systematic approach to hyperparameter tuning was a key factor in successful experiments. Experiments that involved tuning parameters such as `num_epochs`, `learning_rate`, `embedding_dim`, `batch_size`, `weight_decay`, `classifier_hidden_dim`, `dropout_rate`, and `gradient_clip_norm` showed improvements in model performance. Each tuning involved a well-defined range of values and consistent logging of metrics, allowing for easy comparison and selection of the best configuration.\n\n- **Consistent Logging and Storage**: Successful experiments consistently logged training and validation losses, as well as complexity-weighted accuracy (CWA-2D), at each epoch. This data was stored in a structured format (e.g., `experiment_data.npy`), enabling easy retrieval and analysis.\n\n- **Early Stopping and Best Model Retention**: The use of early stopping (with patience) and retaining the best model snapshot based on validation loss were effective strategies to prevent overfitting and ensure optimal model performance.\n\n- **Structured Experimentation**: Each experiment was designed to isolate the effect of a single hyperparameter, keeping all other settings fixed. This approach helped in understanding the impact of each parameter on the model's performance.\n\n- **Visualization**: The generation of loss-curve figures for each hyperparameter setting provided a visual representation of the training process, aiding in the identification of trends and anomalies.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Over-Regularization**: In the dropout rate tuning experiment, higher dropout rates led to increased training and validation losses, as well as decreased CWA-2D. This indicates over-regularization, which can hinder model learning.\n\n- **Lack of Diversity in Hyperparameter Values**: Some experiments might have benefited from a broader range of hyperparameter values. For instance, the weight decay and learning rate experiments could explore more granular values to find optimal settings.\n\n- **Insufficient Epochs for Certain Configurations**: While early stopping is beneficial, it might prematurely halt training for configurations that require more epochs to converge. Ensuring a balance between early stopping and sufficient training time is crucial.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Expand Hyperparameter Ranges**: Consider testing a wider range of values for hyperparameters like learning rate and weight decay to capture more nuanced effects on model performance.\n\n- **Combine Hyperparameter Tuning**: Explore the interaction between multiple hyperparameters by conducting joint tuning experiments. For example, simultaneously tuning learning rate and batch size might yield insights into their combined effect on model performance.\n\n- **Focus on Regularization Techniques**: Given the potential for over-regularization, experiments should carefully evaluate the impact of regularization techniques like dropout and weight decay. Consider adaptive methods that adjust regularization strength based on training progress.\n\n- **Incorporate Advanced Techniques**: Experiment with advanced optimization techniques, such as learning rate schedules or adaptive gradient methods, to potentially enhance model convergence and performance.\n\n- **Ensure Robustness**: Conduct experiments with different random seeds to ensure that results are not due to chance and that the model's performance is robust across different initializations.\n\nBy following these recommendations and learning from both successes and failures, future experiments can be designed to further optimize model performance and gain deeper insights into the effects of various hyperparameters."
