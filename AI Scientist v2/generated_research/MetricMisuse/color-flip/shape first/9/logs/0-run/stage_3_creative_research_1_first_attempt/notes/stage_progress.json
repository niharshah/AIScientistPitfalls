Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Contrastive Pre-training**: Many successful experiments incorporated a contrastive pre-training stage, often using SimCLR-style objectives. This approach consistently improved the model's ability to learn context-aware representations, which translated into higher Complexity-Weighted Accuracy (CompWA) during fine-tuning.\n\n- **Data Augmentation**: Successful experiments often used data augmentation techniques such as token masking, deletion, and shuffling to create diverse views for contrastive learning. These augmentations helped models learn more robust representations by exposing them to varied input scenarios.\n\n- **Early Stopping and Logging**: Implementing early stopping based on validation metrics, such as validation loss or CompWA, was a common practice. This approach prevented overfitting and ensured that the best-performing model snapshot was retained. Comprehensive logging of metrics and losses was also crucial for tracking progress and analyzing results.\n\n- **Lightweight Models and Efficient Training**: The use of lightweight models, such as GRUs and Transformers, allowed experiments to complete within a reasonable time frame (often under 30 minutes). Efficient training setups, including GPU utilization and minimal sequence padding, contributed to the success of these experiments.\n\n- **Complexity-Weighted Objectives**: Incorporating complexity-weighted objectives, where sequences with more unique shapes and colors were given more importance, aligned the training process with the evaluation metric (CompWA) and improved performance.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Dataset Path Issues**: A common failure was related to incorrect dataset paths, leading to FileNotFoundErrors. This issue arose when the script attempted to load data from a non-existent or incorrectly specified location.\n\n- **Over-reliance on Complexity**: While complexity-weighted objectives were beneficial, over-reliance on them without proper data handling or augmentation could lead to suboptimal results if the dataset was not correctly set up or if the complexity weights were not balanced.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Ensure Correct Dataset Paths**: Before running experiments, verify that the dataset paths are correctly specified in the script. Ensure that all necessary files are present in the expected directories to avoid FileNotFoundErrors.\n\n- **Balance Complexity Weights**: While using complexity-weighted objectives, ensure that the weights are balanced and do not overly bias the model towards certain types of sequences. This can be achieved by carefully designing the weighting scheme and validating its impact on a small subset of data before full-scale training.\n\n- **Enhance Data Augmentation**: Continue to explore and refine data augmentation techniques. Consider incorporating more sophisticated augmentations that mimic real-world variations to further improve the model's robustness.\n\n- **Leverage Contrastive Pre-training**: Maintain the use of contrastive pre-training, as it has consistently shown to improve model performance. Experiment with different contrastive loss formulations and augmentation strategies to further enhance learning.\n\n- **Optimize Model and Training Efficiency**: Focus on optimizing model architectures and training processes to ensure experiments remain within time and resource constraints. This includes using lightweight models, efficient data loading, and leveraging available hardware effectively.\n\nBy following these recommendations and building on the patterns of success, future experiments can continue to improve model performance and robustness while avoiding common pitfalls."
