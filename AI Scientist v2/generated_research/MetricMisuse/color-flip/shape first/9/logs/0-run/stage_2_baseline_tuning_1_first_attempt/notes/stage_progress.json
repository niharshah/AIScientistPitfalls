  "current_findings": "## Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Baseline Establishment**: The initial simple supervised baseline with tokenization, embedding, mean-pooling, and a linear classifier was effective. It provided a reproducible end-to-end pipeline that was foundational for further enhancements.\n  \n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic exploration of hyperparameters such as the number of epochs, learning rate, batch size, and embedding dimensions led to improvements in model performance. The best results were achieved by fine-tuning these parameters, indicating their critical role in model optimization.\n\n- **Data Management and Reproducibility**: Consistent logging of metrics, losses, and predictions in a structured format (experiment_data dict) ensured reproducibility and facilitated analysis. Saving results as NumPy arrays and generating loss-curve figures provided clear insights into model training dynamics.\n\n- **Performance Metrics**: The use of complexity-weighted accuracy (CWA-2D) as a key performance metric allowed for a nuanced evaluation of model performance, particularly in complex scenarios.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Overfitting with Larger Models**: Increasing the embedding dimension or batch size without adequate regularization or validation can lead to overfitting. This was observed when larger batch sizes resulted in higher training and validation losses.\n\n- **Insufficient Epochs**: Running models for too few epochs can lead to underfitting, as seen in some hyperparameter tuning experiments where the number of epochs was varied.\n\n- **Lack of Contextual Information**: The initial simple model lacked context-aware features, which could limit its ability to capture more complex relationships in the data.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Contextual Understanding**: Incorporate context-aware contrastive pre-training into the pipeline to improve the model's ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies within the data.\n\n- **Regularization Techniques**: Implement regularization techniques such as dropout or weight decay, especially when using larger models or batch sizes, to mitigate overfitting.\n\n- **Extended Hyperparameter Sweeps**: Continue to explore a wider range of hyperparameters, including more granular learning rates and embedding dimensions, to find optimal configurations.\n\n- **Incremental Complexity**: Gradually increase model complexity by adding layers or using more sophisticated architectures, ensuring that each step is validated against the baseline to confirm improvements.\n\n- **Experiment Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation of each experiment, including configurations, results, and observations, to facilitate knowledge transfer and reproducibility.\n\nBy building on the successful patterns and addressing the identified pitfalls, future experiments can achieve more robust and generalizable results."
