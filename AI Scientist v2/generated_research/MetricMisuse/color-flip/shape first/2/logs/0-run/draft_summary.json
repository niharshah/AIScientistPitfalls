  "Experiment_description": "The experiments investigated symbolic token classification using a contrastive learning approach with a Bi-GRU encoder and supervised baselines with a Bi-LSTM architecture.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are significant as they demonstrate effective methods for symbolic token classification, achieving high accuracy and efficiency. The findings can guide future research in optimizing contrastive learning and refining supervised baselines for similar tasks.",
  "Description": "The experiments involved training models for symbolic token classification using Bi-GRU and Bi-LSTM architectures. The Bi-GRU model used a SimCLR-style contrastive objective, followed by a cross-entropy fine-tuning. The Bi-LSTM models were trained with cross-entropy loss, focusing on efficiency and reproducibility. Implementation challenges, such as DataLoader errors, were addressed to ensure robust training.",
