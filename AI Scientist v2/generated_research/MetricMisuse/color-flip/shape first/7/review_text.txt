    "Summary": "The paper critiques the over-reliance on certain benchmarks in machine learning, arguing that they may be too simple to provide meaningful insights into model performance. Using a dataset referred to as *SPR BENCH*, the authors demonstrate that multiple architectures and hyperparameter configurations achieve near-perfect accuracy, suggesting the benchmark lacks complexity and generalization challenges.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper addresses an important issue in machine learning: the reliance on benchmarks that fail to reflect real-world complexities.",
        "The empirical results support the claim that certain benchmarks may be too easy, leading to inflated performance metrics."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper does not propose any concrete solutions or alternatives to address the issue of overly simple benchmarks.",
        "The experimental analysis is shallow and limited to a single dataset (*SPR BENCH*). There is no attempt to generalize the findings to other benchmarks.",
        "The methodology and experimental setup are poorly described, leaving critical details ambiguous (e.g., how *SPR BENCH* was constructed or why it was chosen).",
        "The findings are not novel, as the issue of benchmark simplicity is a well-known problem in machine learning.",
        "The clarity and organization of the paper are subpar, with poorly explained figures and insufficient discussion of results.",
        "The paper lacks a broader discussion of the implications or potential societal impacts of misleading benchmarks."

    "Questions": [
        "What specific characteristics of *SPR BENCH* make it overly simple? Could you provide more detailed descriptions of the dataset?",
        "Have you evaluated other benchmarks to determine whether this issue is widespread or specific to *SPR BENCH*?",
        "What steps would you recommend to address the problem of overly simple benchmarks? For instance, should new benchmarks include realistic noise, variability, or other features?",
        "How does this work advance the current state of the art in evaluating model performance?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper fails to discuss how *SPR BENCH* was constructed, which limits the reproducibility of the experiments.",
        "The lack of actionable recommendations for improving benchmarks reduces the practical impact of the work.",
        "The analysis is limited to a single dataset and does not explore whether the findings generalize to other benchmarks."
