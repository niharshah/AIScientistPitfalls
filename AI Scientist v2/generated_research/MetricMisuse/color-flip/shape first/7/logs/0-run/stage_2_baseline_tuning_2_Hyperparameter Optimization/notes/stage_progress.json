  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Successful experiments consistently involved systematic hyperparameter tuning. Parameters such as `num_epochs`, `learning_rate`, `batch_size`, `dropout_rate`, `hidden_size`, `embedding_dim`, `weight_decay`, and `gradient_clipping_max_norm` were varied to observe their effects on model performance. This approach allowed for the identification of optimal configurations that improved model metrics.\n\n- **Incremental Improvements**: Gradual increases in parameter values, such as `num_epochs` and `hidden_size`, often led to better performance metrics. For instance, increasing the number of epochs resulted in lower training and validation losses, while larger hidden sizes improved accuracy metrics.\n\n- **Consistent Evaluation and Logging**: Each experiment maintained a consistent evaluation protocol, logging training and validation losses, as well as various accuracy metrics (shape-weighted, color-weighted, harmonic-weighted). This consistency enabled clear comparisons across different configurations.\n\n- **Self-contained and Reproducible Scripts**: The experiments were designed to be self-contained, with minimal changes to the core pipeline. This ensured reproducibility and ease of execution, facilitating the comparison of results across different runs.\n\n- **Effective Use of Resources**: Efficient use of computational resources, such as GPU memory cleanup between runs, ensured that experiments ran smoothly without unnecessary interruptions.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Overfitting**: While not explicitly mentioned as a failure, the potential for overfitting is a common pitfall in hyperparameter tuning, especially with high-capacity models or excessive epochs. Monitoring validation metrics is crucial to avoid this.\n\n- **Lack of Baseline Comparisons**: Some experiments may not have explicitly compared results against a baseline model, which is essential for understanding the impact of hyperparameter changes.\n\n- **Insufficient Exploration of Hyperparameters**: While many hyperparameters were explored, there is always a risk of not covering the entire search space, potentially missing optimal configurations.\n\n- **Complexity vs. Performance Trade-offs**: Increasing model complexity (e.g., larger hidden sizes or embedding dimensions) can improve performance but also increases computational cost and risk of overfitting.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Expand Hyperparameter Search Space**: Consider exploring a wider range of hyperparameter values, including more granular steps for parameters like learning rate and dropout rate, to potentially uncover better configurations.\n\n- **Implement Early Stopping**: To prevent overfitting, implement early stopping based on validation loss or accuracy. This can help halt training when improvements plateau, saving computational resources.\n\n- **Baseline Comparisons**: Always include a baseline model for comparison to clearly demonstrate the impact of hyperparameter tuning and other modifications.\n\n- **Cross-validation**: Incorporate cross-validation to ensure that the model's performance is robust across different data splits, reducing the risk of overfitting to a particular validation set.\n\n- **Regularization Techniques**: Further explore regularization techniques, such as L2 regularization and dropout, to improve model generalization and prevent overfitting.\n\n- **Automated Hyperparameter Optimization**: Consider using automated hyperparameter optimization tools, such as Bayesian optimization or grid search, to systematically explore the hyperparameter space more efficiently.\n\nBy building on the successes and addressing the pitfalls observed in these experiments, future research can achieve more robust and generalizable model performance."
