(b) depicts validation SCWA vs. epoch for three levels (L1, L2, L3), with three distinct curves. Both plots have clear axes labels and legends, and they show expected trends: loss decreases and SCWA increases over epochs.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is well-constructed with clear axes and legends. However, gridlines would improve readability, and using a colorblind-friendly palette would enhance accessibility. The trends are logical and align with typical training and validation behaviors.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption accurately describes the plots but could include key insights about the depicted trends (e.g., decreasing loss, increasing SCWA) to make it more informative and self-contained.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references are missing ([]). Without proper referencing or discussion in the text, the figure's relevance and context are unclear, which reduces its effectiveness in supporting the paper's arguments."

        "Img_description": "The figure contains four subplots: (a) Baseline loss curves for multiple training runs (L1 to L4) showing cross-entropy loss decreasing across epochs, (b) Validation SCWA curves for the same training runs showing SCWA improving and stabilizing over time, (c) Contrastive pre-training loss steadily decreasing across epochs, and (d) a bar chart summarizing test metrics (Acc, SCWA, ACA) with SCWA > 65.0% and CWA < 70.0%.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is generally well-constructed, with clear axes and legends for subplots (a) and (b). Subplots (c) and (d) lack legends or annotations, which could improve clarity. Subplot (d) requires more specific labels or explanations of the metrics shown. A unifying title or organizational improvement to conceptually link the subplots would enhance the figure.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption partially describes the figure but omits details for subplots (c) and (d). It correctly mentions the key findings (SWA > 65.0%, CWA < 70.0%) but could provide more interpretation and a high-level summary. Adding specificity will make the caption more comprehensive.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references for the figure are missing ([]). This weakens the integration of the figure into the paper, as its context or role in the research is not explained. Figrefs should be added to discuss the purpose and implications of the figure's data."

    "figure_3": {
        "Img_description": "The figure shows a plot of training and validation loss curves over 10 epochs. The x-axis represents the number of epochs, while the y-axis represents the cross-entropy loss. Two curves are displayed: the training loss as a dashed blue line and the validation loss as a solid orange line. Both curves decrease significantly in the first few epochs and then plateau near zero, with the validation loss consistently higher than the training loss.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is overall clear and well-labeled with a legend and axis annotations. However, the y-axis could include a more descriptive label to clarify that this is cross-entropy loss for a contrastive fine-tuning task. Adding vertical gridlines along the epochs would improve readability, and explicitly marking the plateau phase could emphasize the convergence behavior.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption is concise and aligns with the figure by noting the higher validation loss and potential overfitting. However, it omits details about the rapid convergence and plateauing of both curves, which are key observations. Adding this information would make the caption more comprehensive.",
        "Figrefs_review": "There are no references to the figure in the main text (`[]`). This is a critical omission, as the figure's content, context, and implications are left unexplained. The main text should include explicit references to the figure, discussing its relationship to the analysis or results presented in the paper."
    },
    "figure_4": {
        "Img_description": "The figure shows two lines representing 'Val Accuracy' and 'Val ACA' over 10 epochs. The x-axis is labeled as 'Epoch,' and the y-axis is labeled as 'Score.' The blue line (Val Accuracy) stabilizes close to 1.00 after a few epochs, while the orange line (Val ACA) starts at approximately 0.89 and fluctuates slightly but remains relatively constant.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is clear in its basic presentation but lacks some important elements for scientific rigor and readability. The y-axis label 'Score' is vague and could specify the metrics being measured. The legend is clear, but the title could better reflect the figure's context. The inclusion of gridlines and error bars would improve interpretability. The variation in 'Val ACA' is minimal, contradicting the claim of uneven improvement in the caption.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption partially aligns with the figure. While it accurately states that 'Accuracy stabilizes,' the claim that 'ACA varies, indicating uneven improvement in certain attribute classes' is overstated given the minimal fluctuation in 'Val ACA.' The caption is concise but could be refined to reflect the actual behavior shown in the figure.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references are completely missing ('[ ]'), which is a critical issue. The figure's content, context, and implications are not integrated into the manuscript, leaving its purpose unclear."

        "Img_review": "The figure is well-structured but could be improved by adding more detailed annotations and explanations. The bar plot's metric labels (e.g., SWA, ACA) should be defined for clarity. Adding visual indicators of key observations, such as the divergence between training and validation loss or accuracy, would enhance interpretability. Additionally, if the figure relates to 'color-based tasks,' this connection should be made explicit either in the figure or its caption.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption partially describes the figure but lacks precision. While it mentions performance degradation without pretraining and links it to color-based tasks, the figure itself does not explicitly demonstrate this relationship. Adding a concise takeaway and explicitly connecting the observed trends to the absence of contrastive initialization would make the caption more effective.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The figure references in the main text are missing. Proper references should contextualize the figure, explain its relevance, and highlight its findings. Without these, the figure's purpose and connection to the study are unclear."

        "Img_description": "The figure consists of three subplots. The left subplot (Loss Curves) shows the loss versus epochs for three conditions: Pretrain MLM, Fine-tune Train, and Fine-tune Val. Loss decreases sharply for pretraining and stabilizes. Fine-tuning losses are much lower and flat. The middle subplot (Validation Metrics) compares Val Accuracy and Val ACA over epochs. Val Accuracy rises to nearly 1.0, while Val ACA remains near zero. The right subplot (Test Metrics) is a bar chart comparing four metrics: ACC (~0.699), SWA, CWA, and ACA (~0.642), with no error bars provided.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is informative but has several issues. Acronyms like ACA, SWA, and CWA are not defined. The bar chart lacks error bars, making it difficult to assess metric variability or significance. The middle plot\u2019s near-zero Val ACA trend is unusual and unexplained. Overall, the figure would benefit from improved labeling and additional context.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption is not fully aligned with the figure. While it mentions 'minimal gains for color-specific patterns,' this is not directly demonstrated in the figure. The caption is somewhat ambiguous and does not offer a clear, concise takeaway. It could be improved by explicitly stating what the figure shows and how it supports the narrative.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references to the figure are missing. This absence leaves the figure without context or explanation. Proper references should explain the figure\u2019s purpose, connect it to the narrative, and clarify unclear trends or metrics."

    "figure_7": {
        "Img_description": "The figure consists of three subplots: (1) 'Pre-training Loss' shows loss decreasing over 10 epochs during pre-training, (2) 'Train vs Val Loss' compares training and validation loss during fine-tuning with a frozen encoder, and (3) 'Validation Accuracy' shows validation accuracy increasing from ~0.988 to ~0.996 over 10 epochs.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is clear, with labeled axes and visually distinct lines. However, the 'Train vs Val Loss' plot lacks a legend, which could confuse readers. The subplots effectively illustrate the trends in pre-training loss, training vs validation loss, and validation accuracy but could benefit from comparative results with non-frozen encoder fine-tuning.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption is concise and emphasizes the conclusion that fixing encoder weights hampers generalization and highlights the need for end-to-end training. However, it does not describe the individual subplots, making it less precise. The caption could explicitly mention the pre-training loss, fine-tuning loss comparison, and validation accuracy trends.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The figure is not referenced in the main text (empty figrefs). This omission makes it unclear how the figure contributes to the overall narrative or analysis in the paper. Proper references are necessary to integrate the figure into the discussion effectively."

The x-axis is labeled 'Epoch,' and the y-axis is labeled 'Loss.' Both the 'Train Loss' and 'Val Loss' decrease rapidly in the first few epochs and plateau after approximately 4 epochs. The right subplot is a bar chart depicting test metrics (ACC, SWA, CWA, ACA) on the x-axis with their respective scores on the y-axis. ACC and SWA have a score of 0.70, CWA is 0.64, and ACA is 0.60.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is clear and well-labeled, with a useful legend for the left subplot. However, the left subplot could benefit from gridlines to improve readability of loss values. The right subplot would be enhanced by adding numerical values on top of the bars and a legend explaining the bar colors. The figure effectively conveys trends and metric comparisons but could be more polished in presentation.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption does not sufficiently describe the figure's content or the relationships shown. While it mentions 'masking-only augmentation' and 'removing shuffling,' these terms are not explicitly illustrated in the figure. Additionally, 'color performance' is ambiguous and not clearly tied to the metrics displayed. A more detailed and specific caption would improve clarity and alignment with the figure.",
        "Figrefs_review": "No references to the figure are present in the main text, making it difficult to assess its context or relevance. Proper integration of the figure into the discussion, along with detailed explanations of its purpose and findings, is necessary for effective communication."
