    "Summary": "The paper proposes a context-aware contrastive learning framework for symbolic pattern recognition, particularly targeting the Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) task. It improves shape-weighted accuracy but falls short on color-weighted accuracy, revealing limitations in handling color-specific patterns. The proposed method uses token-level augmentations and denoising strategies alongside a GRU-based encoder to learn robust representations.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper addresses an underexplored area of symbolic reasoning using contrastive learning, which is a novel application.",
        "Partial improvement is achieved for shape-weighted accuracy, surpassing the benchmark of 65.0%.",
        "The authors acknowledge the limitations of their approach and suggest future directions for improvement."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The contributions are incremental, with improvements in one metric (SWA) but a failure to meet benchmarks for another critical metric (CWA). This raises questions about the overall utility of the approach.",
        "The methodology lacks technical depth and does not adequately explain why the proposed contrastive learning strategy struggles with color-specific patterns.",
        "The experimental design is limited, with insufficient ablation studies and no exploration of alternative architectures or augmentations to address the identified weaknesses.",
        "Key components, such as the augmentation strategies and denoising techniques, are described vaguely, making it hard to reproduce or fully understand the approach.",
        "The paper does not adequately discuss societal impact, ethical considerations, or limitations, which is necessary for a comprehensive evaluation of its contributions."

    "Questions": [
        "Can the authors provide more detailed explanations of the augmentation strategies (e.g., token shuffling and masking) and how these interact with the contrastive objective?",
        "What specific steps were taken to address the failure of the contrastive process in separating color-based patterns?",
        "Were alternative architectures, such as transformers or graph neural networks, considered for encoding symbolic sequences? If not, why?",
        "How does the proposed approach compare to other pre-training methods, such as masked language modeling (MLM), as suggested in the supplementary material?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The failure to improve color-weighted accuracy suggests a fundamental limitation in the contrastive learning approach for certain symbolic attributes. This was not thoroughly explored.",
        "The paper does not discuss the potential societal impact or ethical concerns of applying this approach to symbolic reasoning tasks. For example, could the learned representations be biased or fail in critical real-world applications?"
