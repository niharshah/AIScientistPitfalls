        "Img_description": "The image is a placeholder with the text 'example_figure.png' centered on a blank background. No actual figure, data, or visualization is present.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is missing, making it impossible to analyze the content, structure, or any potential issues. The inclusion of the actual figure is necessary to evaluate its quality and relevance.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption describes a scenario involving a sudden divergence during a training run at epoch 10. While concise and seemingly relevant, it cannot be validated against the missing figure. If included, the caption could benefit from a brief mention of the key metric involved (e.g., loss or accuracy).",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references are empty ([]), providing no context or discussion about the figure. This makes it unclear how the figure supports the paper's arguments, claims, or findings. The references should explicitly describe the figure's purpose and relevance."

    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The figure is a placeholder image with the text 'appendix_figure.png'. It does not contain any graphical content, data, or visual representation.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is missing. This placeholder fails to contribute to the paper's objectives. A properly constructed figure is required to substantiate the claims made in both the caption and the main text. The absence of content is a critical issue.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption suggests the figure should depict an additional diverging training run, which aligns with the referenced context. However, the placeholder image does not allow assessment of whether the caption is accurate or provides a meaningful takeaway. The caption itself is concise and appropriate if the corresponding figure were present.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure as providing additional details on divergence at a later step. Without an actual figure, this reference is incomplete and fails to fulfill its purpose. This is a significant issue in terms of scientific communication and reproducibility."
