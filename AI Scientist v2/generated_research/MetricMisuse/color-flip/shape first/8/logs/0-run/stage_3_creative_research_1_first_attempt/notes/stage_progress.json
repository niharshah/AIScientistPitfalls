Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Batch Size Optimization**: Successful experiments often included hyperparameter tuning, particularly focusing on batch sizes. A batch size of 256 consistently yielded effective results, balancing runtime and performance.\n\n- **Joint Objectives**: Incorporating multiple objectives, such as combining contrastive learning with a denoising-language-model (MLM) objective, led to richer, more context-aware embeddings. This approach improved metrics like Context-Complexity Weighted Accuracy (CCWA).\n\n- **Augmentation Techniques**: Effective data augmentation strategies, such as manipulating raw token strings before padding, significantly improved model performance by avoiding degenerate contrastive objectives.\n\n- **Error Fixes and Robustness**: Addressing specific bugs, such as indexing errors in the SimCLR loss or issues with data augmentation on padded sequences, led to substantial improvements in training and validation metrics.\n\n- **Self-Contained Scripts**: Designing scripts to be self-contained, with synthetic fallbacks for datasets, ensured that experiments could run end-to-end without external dependencies, improving reproducibility and robustness.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Dataset Loading Issues**: A recurring issue was the failure to load the real SPR_BENCH dataset due to missing modules or incorrect paths, leading to reliance on synthetic data that did not accurately represent the intended dataset.\n\n- **Method Implementation Errors**: Errors such as missing methods (e.g., the 'mlm' method in the 'SymbolicTransformer' class) led to execution failures. Ensuring that all methods are correctly implemented and tested is crucial.\n\n- **Synthetic Data Limitations**: While synthetic fallbacks were useful for ensuring script execution, they often did not capture the complexity of the real dataset, leading to less meaningful results.\n\n- **Validation Metric Stagnation**: In some cases, validation metrics like CCWA did not improve significantly, indicating potential issues with the training process or the relevance of the synthetic dataset.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Ensure Dataset Accessibility**: Verify that all necessary modules and datasets are correctly installed and accessible. Consider automating checks for dataset paths and module availability to prevent execution failures.\n\n- **Enhance Synthetic Data Quality**: If relying on synthetic data, invest in creating datasets that closely mimic the properties of the real dataset to ensure more meaningful training and evaluation.\n\n- **Robust Method Implementations**: Thoroughly test all methods and ensure they are correctly implemented. Consider implementing unit tests for critical components like data augmentation and loss calculations.\n\n- **Focus on Joint Objectives**: Continue exploring joint objectives that combine different learning paradigms, as they have shown to improve the richness and context-awareness of embeddings.\n\n- **Augmentation and Pre-processing**: Prioritize effective data augmentation and pre-processing techniques that maintain the integrity of the data and avoid introducing biases or degenerate objectives.\n\n- **Monitor and Address Metric Stagnation**: Regularly monitor validation metrics and investigate any stagnation or lack of improvement. This may involve revisiting the training pipeline, loss functions, or augmentation techniques.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations and learning from both successes and failures, future experiments can be more robust, efficient, and yield more meaningful insights."
