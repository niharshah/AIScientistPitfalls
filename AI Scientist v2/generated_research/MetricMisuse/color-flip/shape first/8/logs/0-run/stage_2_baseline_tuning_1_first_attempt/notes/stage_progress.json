  "current_findings": "### Comprehensive Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Contrastive Pre-training**: The use of a Bi-LSTM encoder with contrastive pre-training using NT-Xent loss was effective. This approach helped in generating robust embeddings by creating two correlated views of sequences through symbol-level augmentations.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic hyperparameter tuning, such as adjusting the number of fine-tuning epochs (FT_EPOCHS), learning rates, batch sizes, and SimCLR temperature, led to improvements in metrics like SCWA and MWA. This indicates the importance of carefully selecting and tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.\n\n- **Metric Tracking and Logging**: Successful experiments consistently tracked and logged key metrics such as training/validation loss, SCWA, SWA, CWA, and MWA. This facilitated the monitoring of model performance and informed adjustments during training.\n\n- **Device Handling**: Ensuring all tensors, models, and batches were moved to the correct device (GPU when available) contributed to the smooth execution of experiments and improved computational efficiency.\n\n- **Robustness to Missing Data**: The ability to handle missing real datasets by generating synthetic data allowed the experiments to run end-to-end, ensuring the code's robustness and flexibility.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Dependency Issues**: A recurring issue was the failure to load the real SPR_BENCH dataset due to missing modules or incorrect paths. This often resulted in the use of synthetic data, which may not fully replicate the characteristics of the real dataset.\n\n- **Import Errors**: Problems with importing necessary utilities, such as the 'SPR' module, led to misleading evaluations. These issues were often due to undefined variables like '__file__' in the execution environment.\n\n- **Metric Misalignment**: Initial experiments used custom metrics not aligned with official benchmarks, leading to misguided training. Ensuring the use of standard metrics is crucial for valid evaluations.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Ensure Dependency Management**: Verify that all necessary modules and datasets are correctly installed and accessible. Consider using virtual environments or containerization to manage dependencies consistently.\n\n- **Standardize Metric Evaluation**: Align with official benchmark metrics to ensure valid and comparable evaluations. This includes computing and logging SWA, CWA, and MWA consistently.\n\n- **Enhance Import Robustness**: Avoid reliance on environment-specific variables like '__file__' for dynamic imports. Use hardcoded paths or environment variables to ensure robust module loading.\n\n- **Continue Hyperparameter Exploration**: Given the success of hyperparameter tuning, continue exploring a wider range of hyperparameters, including more complex architectures or different types of augmentations.\n\n- **Improve Dataset Handling**: While synthetic data handling is useful, prioritize resolving issues with real dataset access to ensure experiments are grounded in realistic scenarios.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes observed and mitigate common pitfalls, leading to more reliable and insightful outcomes."
