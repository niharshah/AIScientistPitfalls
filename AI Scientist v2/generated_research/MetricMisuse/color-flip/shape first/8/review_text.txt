    "Summary": "The paper investigates a novel sequence modeling architecture intended for resource-constrained settings. It highlights significant instability and training challenges, demonstrating poor reliability and performance as compared to a simple baseline. The authors identify potential pitfalls but fail to provide actionable solutions or deeper insights into the causes of these issues.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper addresses an important issue in machine learning: the instability of novel architectures in real-world settings.",
        "Negative results are valuable for the community to recognize limitations and potential pitfalls in model design."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The scope of the work is limited, with experiments conducted on only one dataset and a small number of runs (3 trials). This makes the results less robust and generalizable.",
        "The paper does not provide significant theoretical insights or novel contributions. It primarily documents an empirical observation of instability without advancing the field.",
        "Insufficient detail is provided about the architecture and experimental setup to enable reproducibility. For example, hyperparameter tuning, dataset preprocessing, and architectural specifics are vaguely described.",
        "The analysis of failure modes is shallow. While large gradients and parameter reuse are mentioned, no in-depth diagnostic experiments or mitigation strategies are proposed.",
        "The writing lacks clarity and fails to provide actionable takeaways or future directions beyond general suggestions like refining optimization techniques."

    "Questions": [
        "Can the authors provide more detailed descriptions of the architecture and experimental setup to improve reproducibility?",
        "Have alternative architectures or training strategies been explored to mitigate the instability? If so, why are these results not included in the paper?",
        "Can the authors conduct more diagnostic experiments to better understand the root causes of the instability (e.g., gradient norms, visualization of attention weights)?",
        "Why is the experimental evaluation limited to only three runs and one dataset? Can additional experiments improve the robustness of the conclusions?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not adequately address the broader implications or potential societal impacts of its findings.",
        "The conclusions are based on limited experimental evidence and fail to provide actionable solutions or meaningful insights."
