    "Summary": "The paper discusses pitfalls in deep clustering methods applied to symbolic tasks, particularly focusing on issues like hyperparameter sensitivity, incomplete supervision, and anomalous training logs. It aims to shed light on these problems through controlled experiments and offers lessons for practitioners.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper addresses practical issues in deploying deep clustering methods for symbolic tasks, such as the sensitivity to hyperparameters and logging anomalies.",
        "The negative results and inconclusive findings can stimulate discussions in the community about robustness and reproducibility in deep clustering."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The technical contribution is minimal and lacks originality; the paper primarily identifies problems without offering novel solutions.",
        "The experiments are poorly designed and lack sufficient rigor. For example, the use of synthetic shapes as data is overly simplistic and does not convincingly simulate real-world symbolic tasks.",
        "Key details about the methodology are missing, such as the exact configurations of the clustering models and preprocessing steps.",
        "The discussion of results is shallow and fails to provide actionable insights or deeper analysis of the observed anomalies.",
        "The writing is unclear in multiple places, and critical claims are vaguely supported or not supported at all.",
        "There is little to no theoretical or empirical advancement over existing work in deep clustering or symbolic reasoning."

    "Questions": [
        "Can the authors provide more details on the experimental setup, particularly the configurations of the clustering models and preprocessing steps?",
        "What specific steps were taken to ensure that the observed anomalies are not due to implementation bugs?",
        "Have the authors considered applying more sophisticated datasets or tasks to better validate their findings?",
        "What actionable insights or recommendations can practitioners take away from this paper beyond 'monitor logging and hyperparameters'?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not provide adequate solutions to the identified pitfalls, and its conclusions are limited to general observations about hyperparameter sensitivity and logging issues.",
        "The scope is limited to synthetic tasks, which undermines the relevance of the findings to real-world scenarios."
