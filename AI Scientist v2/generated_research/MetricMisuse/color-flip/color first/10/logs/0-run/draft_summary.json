  "Experiment_description": "The experiments conducted involved using K-Means clustering to group glyphs from the SPR_BENCH dataset into 2-D categorical clusters, subsequently forming fixed-length vector representations of sequences. These vectors were then used to train a feed-forward neural network to predict sequence labels, with primary evaluation metrics including Complexity-Weighted Accuracy.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are crucial for establishing a baseline methodology for sequence classification using clustering and neural networks. The findings highlight areas for improvement in model design and training strategies, such as addressing biases and optimizing learning rates, which are essential for developing more robust and accurate models in future research.",
  "Description": "The methodology involved representing each glyph as a point in a 2-D categorical space, followed by clustering using K-Means with k=8. These clusters were converted into fixed-length vectors representing sequences, which were input into a feed-forward neural network for label prediction. Key metrics such as Complexity-Weighted Accuracy were tracked to evaluate model performance.",
