Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Data Representation and Clustering**: Successful experiments effectively utilized a 2-D categorical space to represent glyphs, followed by k-means clustering to discover latent glyph clusters. This approach provided a robust feature extraction method that facilitated subsequent classification tasks.\n\n- **Model Architecture**: A simple yet effective model architecture was employed, consisting of a tiny feed-forward PyTorch network with a single hidden layer (32 ReLU units). This minimalistic design was sufficient to capture the necessary patterns in the data, as evidenced by the consistent improvement in complexity-weighted accuracy (CompWA).\n\n- **Metric Tracking and Evaluation**: Successful experiments diligently tracked multiple metrics, including training and validation losses, as well as complexity-weighted accuracy. This comprehensive evaluation approach allowed for a nuanced understanding of model performance across different dimensions.\n\n- **Pipeline Integration**: The entire experimental pipeline\u2014from data loading to model training and evaluation\u2014was integrated into a single, cohesive script. This ensured that all components worked seamlessly together and adhered to GPU/CPU handling rules.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Dataset Availability and Path Issues**: A recurring issue in failed experiments was the unavailability of the dataset files or incorrect file paths. This led to FileNotFoundErrors, halting the execution of the experiments.\n\n- **Synthetic Dataset Generation**: Several experiments failed due to errors in generating synthetic datasets. Issues such as incorrect input formats and missing valid examples resulted in DatasetGenerationErrors and SchemaInferenceErrors.\n\n- **Error Handling**: Inadequate error handling led to difficulties in diagnosing and resolving issues related to data loading and synthetic dataset generation. This lack of specificity in error messages hindered efficient debugging.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Ensure Dataset Accessibility**: Before running experiments, verify the presence and correct path of all necessary dataset files. Consider implementing a pre-execution check to confirm dataset availability and path correctness.\n\n- **Improve Synthetic Dataset Logic**: Revise the synthetic dataset generation process to ensure compatibility with the expected input format. Consider using temporary files or in-memory datasets to avoid JSON serialization issues. Ensure that synthetic datasets include valid examples with the required fields.\n\n- **Enhance Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling mechanisms to provide clear and specific error messages. This will facilitate quicker diagnosis and resolution of issues related to data loading and processing.\n\n- **Maintain Simplicity in Model Design**: Continue leveraging simple model architectures that have proven effective, such as the small feed-forward network used in successful experiments. Focus on optimizing data representation and feature extraction techniques to improve model performance.\n\n- **Comprehensive Metric Evaluation**: Maintain the practice of tracking a diverse set of metrics to gain a holistic understanding of model performance. This will help identify areas for improvement and guide future iterations of the experiments."
