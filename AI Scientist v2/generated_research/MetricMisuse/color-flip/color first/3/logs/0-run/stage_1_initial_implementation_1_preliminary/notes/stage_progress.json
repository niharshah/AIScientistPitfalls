  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Robust Path Handling:** Successful experiments consistently implemented robust path discovery mechanisms to locate dataset files. This involved scanning multiple potential locations, including environment variables, relative paths, and absolute paths, to ensure the dataset could be found regardless of the script's execution directory.\n\n- **Consistent Metric Tracking:** Successful experiments maintained consistent tracking of key metrics such as training loss, validation loss, Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), and Harmonic Color-Shape Accuracy (HCSA). This allowed for comprehensive evaluation of model performance across different stages of training.\n\n- **Backward Compatibility and Updates:** Successful experiments replaced deprecated arguments (e.g., `n_init=\"auto\"`) with backward-compatible alternatives (e.g., `n_init=10`) to ensure compatibility with different versions of libraries like scikit-learn.\n\n- **Normalization and Preprocessing:** Normalizing inputs, such as histogram data, was a common practice in successful experiments to avoid scale problems and improve model performance.\n\n- **Device Handling Compliance:** Successful experiments adhered to device-handling guidelines, ensuring that models and data were appropriately transferred to GPU when available, leading to efficient execution.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **FileNotFoundError:** A recurring issue in failed experiments was the inability to locate dataset files due to incorrect or hard-coded paths. This often resulted in FileNotFoundError, halting the experiment's progress.\n\n- **Incorrect Dataset Handling:** Some experiments failed due to improper handling of synthetic datasets, such as using in-memory objects where file paths were expected, leading to AttributeError.\n\n- **Lack of Path Verification:** Failed experiments often did not verify the existence of dataset files at specified paths, leading to execution errors when the files were not found.\n\n- **Inadequate Error Messaging:** In some cases, the error messages were not informative enough, making it difficult to diagnose and fix the underlying issues quickly.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Implement Robust Path Discovery:** Future experiments should incorporate a robust path discovery mechanism to locate dataset files. This should include checking environment variables, scanning common directory structures, and providing clear error messages if the dataset is not found.\n\n- **Ensure Consistent Metric Tracking:** Maintain comprehensive tracking of all relevant metrics throughout the training process to facilitate performance evaluation and comparison across different experiments.\n\n- **Update and Test Compatibility:** Regularly update code to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of libraries and test for backward compatibility to avoid deprecated argument issues.\n\n- **Normalize Input Data:** Consistently apply normalization and preprocessing steps to input data to prevent scale-related issues and improve model performance.\n\n- **Verify Dataset Availability:** Before starting an experiment, verify that the dataset files are available at the specified paths. Consider implementing checks that confirm the presence of necessary files before proceeding with the experiment.\n\n- **Improve Error Messaging:** Enhance error messaging to provide clear and informative feedback when issues arise, aiding in quicker diagnosis and resolution of problems.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes and avoid the pitfalls observed in past experiments, leading to more reliable and efficient research outcomes."
