The stages focused on resolving technical issues, optimizing the data pipeline, and refining the model to improve classification performance.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are crucial as they address foundational challenges in symbolic data processing, focusing on clustering and classification. The insights gained can enhance symbolic recognition systems and inform future optimizations in related fields, such as natural language processing and computer vision.",
  "Description": "The experiments explored clustering glyphs into clusters using K-means based on one-hot encoding or two-dimensional vectors. The clustered features were used as inputs for classification models. Key improvements included resolving dataset path issues, input normalization, and updating model parameters to enhance robustness and reliability. The nodes collectively aimed to establish a robust baseline for symbolic data exploration.",
