  "current_findings": "## Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Order-Aware Sequence Encoding**: The transition from order-agnostic histograms to an order-aware sequence encoder using a bidirectional GRU was a significant success. This approach effectively captured ordering and repetition patterns, leading to high validation and test metrics across various accuracy measures (CWA, SWA, HCSA, SNWA).\n\n- **Glyph Clustering**: The use of K-means clustering to map glyphs to latent clusters (k=16) proved effective in maintaining a symbolic glyph clustering philosophy while being computationally efficient. This clustering was crucial for achieving high sequence-novelty-weighted accuracy.\n\n- **Early Stopping**: Implementing early stopping based on the dev Harmonic CSA was beneficial in preventing overfitting and ensuring optimal model performance.\n\n- **Robustness to Ablations**: The experiments demonstrated robustness to various ablations, such as removing bidirectionality from the GRU, freezing cluster embeddings, and using random cluster assignments. Despite these modifications, the models maintained high validation metrics, indicating the strength of the core design.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Loss of Sequential Information**: The \"Shuffled-Sequence-Order\" ablation highlighted the importance of preserving sequence order. Randomly permuting sequences led to a noticeable drop in performance, underscoring the need to maintain positional information.\n\n- **Simplified Encoders**: The \"Mean-Pooling-Encoder\" ablation showed that replacing the GRU with a permutation-invariant mean-pooling encoder resulted in lower test metrics, emphasizing the importance of capturing sequential structure.\n\n- **Random Cluster Assignments**: Using random glyph-to-cluster assignments, as seen in the \"Random-Cluster-Assignments\" ablation, resulted in lower test metrics, particularly in CWA and SWA, reinforcing the value of data-driven clustering.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Sequence Encoding**: Further explore and refine sequence encoding techniques that capture complex patterns and dependencies. Consider experimenting with more advanced architectures like transformers or attention mechanisms to potentially improve performance.\n\n- **Optimize Clustering**: Investigate alternative clustering methods or hyperparameter tuning (e.g., different values of k in K-means) to enhance the symbolic representation of glyphs and improve novelty-weighted accuracy.\n\n- **Maintain Sequential Integrity**: Ensure that any modifications to the data pipeline preserve the order and structure of sequences. Avoid approaches that treat sequences as unordered sets, as this can lead to significant performance degradation.\n\n- **Experiment with Embedding Strategies**: Explore different strategies for embedding clusters, such as learnable embeddings with varying initialization schemes, to assess their impact on model performance.\n\n- **Evaluate Early Stopping Criteria**: While early stopping proved beneficial, consider experimenting with different criteria or thresholds to optimize the balance between training duration and model performance.\n\nBy building on these insights and recommendations, future experiments can continue to push the boundaries of state-of-the-art performance while avoiding common pitfalls observed in past experiments."
