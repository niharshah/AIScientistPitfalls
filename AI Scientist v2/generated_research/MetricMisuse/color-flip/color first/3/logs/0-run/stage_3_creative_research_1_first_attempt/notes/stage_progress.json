  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning and Early Stopping**: Successful experiments consistently utilized hyperparameter tuning, particularly for the number of training epochs, and implemented early stopping based on validation metrics. This approach effectively prevented overfitting and optimized model performance.\n\n- **Clustering Techniques**: K-means clustering was frequently used to group glyphs into latent clusters, which were then used as inputs for various models. This method proved effective in capturing symbolic relationships and improving model accuracy.\n\n- **Lightweight Models**: The use of lightweight models, such as small feed-forward networks, GRUs, and LSTMs, ensured fast training times while maintaining high accuracy. These models were able to capture essential patterns without the computational overhead of more complex architectures.\n\n- **Metric Tracking and Data Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of metrics such as Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), Harmonic Color-Shape Accuracy (HCSA), and Sequence Novelty Weighted Accuracy (SNWA) was a common practice. Storing all metrics, losses, predictions, and ground-truth data in a structured format facilitated later analysis and comparison.\n\n- **Feature Engineering**: Successful experiments often combined glyph-cluster histograms with explicit color/shape variety features, enhancing the model's ability to generalize and capture nuanced patterns.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Inadequate Clustering Parameters**: A recurring issue in failed experiments was setting the number of clusters (k) in K-means clustering to a value greater than the number of unique glyphs. This mismatch led to ValueErrors and halted execution.\n\n- **Overly Complex Models**: While not explicitly mentioned in the failures, the emphasis on lightweight models in successful experiments suggests that overly complex models may not be necessary and could lead to inefficiencies or overfitting.\n\n- **Insufficient Data for Clustering**: The failures highlighted the importance of ensuring that the dataset contains enough unique samples to support the desired number of clusters. This requires careful consideration of the dataset's characteristics before setting clustering parameters.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Adjust Clustering Parameters Dynamically**: To avoid clustering errors, implement a dynamic adjustment of the number of clusters based on the number of unique glyphs. For example, set `k_clusters = min(desired_k, number_of_unique_glyphs)`.\n\n- **Continue Using Lightweight Models**: Maintain the use of lightweight models that balance computational efficiency with accuracy. This approach has consistently yielded positive results and should be a standard practice.\n\n- **Enhance Feature Engineering**: Explore additional feature engineering techniques that combine symbolic and explicit features. Consider experimenting with different combinations of features to uncover new patterns and insights.\n\n- **Expand Hyperparameter Tuning**: While tuning the number of epochs has been effective, consider expanding hyperparameter tuning to other model parameters, such as learning rates, batch sizes, and model architecture configurations, to further optimize performance.\n\n- **Ensure Comprehensive Metric Tracking**: Continue the practice of tracking a wide range of metrics and storing all relevant data for post-experiment analysis. This will facilitate a deeper understanding of model performance and areas for improvement.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes and avoid common pitfalls, leading to more robust and insightful results."
