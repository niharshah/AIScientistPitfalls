        "Img_description": "The image consists of two empty panels, left and right, separated by whitespace. Neither panel contains visible data, such as curves, points, axes, or labels.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is incomplete and lacks critical components such as axes, labels, legends, or any graphical data. It is impossible to analyze or derive conclusions from this figure in its current state. Improvements should include adding the missing graphical elements to support the claims made in the caption.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption describes specific behaviors (rapid dev loss decrease, dev\u2013test accuracy divergence) that are not visually represented in the figure. While the caption is concise and includes a clear takeaway, it is entirely misaligned with the empty figure.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure in detail, explaining expected behaviors and conclusions. However, the figure is blank, rendering these references unsupported. The references would be appropriate if the figure were properly rendered and aligned with the described behaviors."
