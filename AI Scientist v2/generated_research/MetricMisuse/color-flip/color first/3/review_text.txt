    "Summary": "The paper explores overfitting and dev-test mismatches in symbolic clustering methods. It highlights potential pitfalls of symbolic clustering in real-world settings with domain shifts and variability. However, the paper primarily reports negative results and fails to provide novel methodologies or significant insights to address the identified issues.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper tackles an important issue of overfitting and generalization in symbolic clustering, particularly in real-world applications with domain shifts.",
        "The experiments provide some empirical evidence of dev-test performance gaps and overfitting patterns."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper lacks novelty as it primarily reports negative results without proposing new methods or solutions to mitigate the observed issues.",
        "The experimental setup is limited in scope and does not provide sufficient breadth or depth to generalize the findings.",
        "The presentation is unclear and lacks detailed quantitative results, making it difficult to assess the robustness of the claims.",
        "The paper does not offer actionable insights or concrete design guidelines for improving symbolic clustering methods under domain shifts.",
        "The related work section is sparse and does not adequately situate the study within the broader context of symbolic learning and clustering literature."
