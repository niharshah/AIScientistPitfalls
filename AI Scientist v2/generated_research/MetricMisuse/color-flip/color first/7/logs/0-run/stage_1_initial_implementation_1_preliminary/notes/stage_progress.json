Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Baseline Establishment**: Successful experiments often start with a simple, well-defined baseline. For instance, the plain sequence-classification baseline using a bag-of-glyph representation provided a strong reference point. This approach ensures a functional pipeline from data preparation to evaluation.\n\n- **Glyph Clustering**: Clustering glyphs by shape or symbolic characteristics before feeding them into a model has shown to be beneficial. This pre-processing step allows for a more compact representation that can speed up training and improve certain metrics, such as Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA).\n\n- **Metric Tracking and Logging**: Consistent tracking of key metrics like Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), and Complexity-Weighted Accuracy (CpxWA) is crucial. Successful experiments log these metrics at each epoch, allowing for detailed analysis and comparison against state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks.\n\n- **Device Handling**: Proper management of device allocation (CUDA vs. CPU) ensures that models run efficiently and without errors. Successful experiments adhere to mandatory device-handling rules.\n\n- **Structured Experiment Data**: Storing results in a structured format (e.g., `experiment_data` dictionary) facilitates later analysis and comparison across different experimental runs.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Lack of Baseline**: Starting experiments without a clear baseline can lead to difficulties in assessing improvements or understanding the impact of new methods.\n\n- **Inadequate Pre-processing**: Skipping pre-processing steps like glyph clustering can result in less efficient models that do not fully exploit the data's latent structure.\n\n- **Insufficient Metric Tracking**: Failing to track and log relevant metrics can hinder the ability to evaluate model performance comprehensively and make informed adjustments.\n\n- **Device Mismanagement**: Incorrect handling of device allocation can lead to runtime errors or inefficient execution, especially in GPU-accelerated environments.\n\n- **Poor Data Management**: Not saving experiment data in a structured format can complicate result analysis and hinder reproducibility.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Establish a Strong Baseline**: Begin with a simple, well-documented baseline model. This will serve as a reference point for evaluating the effectiveness of new techniques.\n\n- **Incorporate Pre-processing Techniques**: Consider using glyph clustering or other pre-processing methods to enhance model input representations. This can lead to faster training and improved performance on specific metrics.\n\n- **Comprehensive Metric Tracking**: Ensure that all relevant metrics are tracked and logged consistently. This will facilitate a thorough evaluation of model performance and comparison against SOTA benchmarks.\n\n- **Adhere to Device Handling Best Practices**: Follow best practices for device management to ensure efficient and error-free execution, particularly when using GPU resources.\n\n- **Maintain Structured Experiment Data**: Save all experiment results in a structured format to enable easy analysis and comparison across different runs. This will also support reproducibility and collaborative research efforts.\n\nBy following these recommendations and learning from both successful and failed experiments, future research can build on existing progress and continue to advance the field."
