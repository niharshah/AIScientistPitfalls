  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Glyph-Clustering Preprocessing**: Integrating a glyph-clustering preprocessing layer, which involves learning a tiny auto-encoder on one-hot glyphs and clustering them with K-means, has shown significant success. This approach provides higher-level symbolic hints to the network, leading to high accuracy across various metrics.\n\n- **Robustness to Variations**: The experiments demonstrated robustness to different variations, such as random cluster assignments and shape-based clustering. Even when clusters were assigned randomly or based solely on shape, the models still achieved high accuracy, indicating the flexibility and robustness of the underlying architecture.\n\n- **Effective Use of Ablations**: The use of ablations, such as removing the RNN or using only cluster embeddings, provided insights into the contributions of different components. These ablations helped isolate the value of specific features, such as the GRU encoder and token-level embeddings.\n\n- **Bug Fixes and Data Handling**: Addressing bugs related to data handling, such as mismatched ordering between DataLoader batches and raw sequences, was crucial. Ensuring that predictions were aligned with their sequences improved the validity of the metrics.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Over-Reliance on Specific Components**: The failed experiment involving the removal of the cluster embedding pathway suggests that certain components are critical for the model's performance. Removing key pathways without adequate compensation can lead to failures.\n\n- **Data Handling Issues**: Initial issues with data handling, such as shuffled DataLoader batches leading to incorrect metric computation, highlight the importance of maintaining correct data ordering and alignment throughout the pipeline.\n\n- **Lack of Error Analysis**: The failed experiment did not provide detailed error analysis, which is essential for understanding the root causes of failures and guiding future improvements.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Clustering Techniques**: Building on the success of glyph-clustering, future experiments could explore more sophisticated clustering techniques or hybrid approaches that combine multiple clustering methods to capture even richer symbolic representations.\n\n- **Focus on Component Interactions**: Given the success of ablations in isolating component contributions, future experiments should continue to explore the interactions between different components, such as the auto-encoder, GRU, and clustering layers, to optimize the overall architecture.\n\n- **Improve Error Analysis**: Implementing more comprehensive error analysis for failed experiments will provide deeper insights into potential pitfalls and guide more targeted improvements.\n\n- **Robust Data Handling**: Ensuring robust data handling practices, such as maintaining correct data ordering and alignment, should be a priority to prevent metric computation errors and improve the reliability of experimental results.\n\n- **Explore Alternative Architectures**: Given the success of the bag-of-embeddings approach, exploring alternative architectures that do not rely on traditional RNNs could provide new avenues for improving performance and efficiency.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, future experiments can build on the successes and learn from the failures to achieve even greater advancements in the field."
