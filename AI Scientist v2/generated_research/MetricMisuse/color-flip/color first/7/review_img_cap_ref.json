    "figure_1": {
        "Img_description": "The figure contains two subplots: (a) 'Baseline' and (b) 'Clustering,' both showing Weighted Accuracy on the SPR BENCH dataset. Subplot (a) shows three lines labeled 'Val CWA,' 'Val SWA,' and 'Val Cpx WA,' which increase steadily from about 0.04, with one surpassing 0.9. Subplot (b) also has three lines labeled similarly, but they reach nearly 1.0, demonstrating clustering's superior performance. The x-axis represents 'Epoch,' and the y-axis represents 'Weighted Accuracy.' A legend is present, but the font size is small.",
        "Img_review": "The figure effectively conveys the performance comparison between baseline and clustering approaches using Weighted Accuracy. However, readability issues such as small font sizes for axis labels, legends, and titles detract from its clarity. Additionally, the meaning of terms like 'CWA,' 'SWA,' and 'Cpx WA' is not explained, leaving the figure incomplete for readers unfamiliar with the context.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption aligns with the figure's content and outlines the key points, such as the baseline's progression from 0.04 to above 0.9 and clustering's nearly saturated performance. However, it lacks detail about the specific lines and their significance. Adding a concise explanation of the terms and a clear takeaway would improve the caption.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure adequately, mentioning its purpose and key findings. It describes the baseline and clustering performance and notes the sensitivity to glyph variations. However, the references could be improved by explicitly clarifying the meaning of the lines and terms used in the figure to provide more context."
    },
    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The figure consists of two subplots: (a) 'Baseline,' which shows Weighted Accuracy (y-axis) versus Epoch (x-axis), and (b) 'Clustering,' which shows Weighted Accuracy (y-axis) across different clusters (x-axis). Subplot (a) depicts a transition in accuracy from 0.04 to 0.9 over time, while subplot (b) illustrates variation in accuracy across clusters.",
        "Img_review": "The figure provides a useful visualization of weighted accuracy across two dimensions (epochs and clusters), but it suffers from unclear legends and insufficient context about the clusters in subplot (b). Subplot (a) lacks clarity on what each line represents. Adding a legend or more descriptive labels would improve interpretability.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption is partially accurate but lacks specificity. While it highlights the Bag-of-Embeddings approach and its ability to achieve high accuracy, the figure does not explicitly label or isolate this method, making the claim difficult to verify from the figure alone. The caption could be expanded to include more detail about the subplots and their relationship to the claim.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure but does so in a general manner. It mentions memorization and the Bag-of-Embeddings approach but does not provide specific observations or trends that can be directly tied to the figure. More detailed integration of the figure's content into the text would improve clarity."
    },
    "figure_3": {
        "Img_description": "The figure contains four subplots showing the performance of a cluster-only representation across different metrics over epochs. The metrics include training loss, complexity-weighted accuracy, color-weighted accuracy, and shape-weighted accuracy. Each subplot plots training and validation curves, with the x-axis representing epochs and the y-axis representing the respective metric.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is generally clear and well-organized, with appropriate legends and axis labels. However, the axes labels could be more descriptive, and additional annotations could clarify the metrics being evaluated. The figure does not provide a direct comparison to standard embeddings, which weakens its ability to substantiate the claim in the caption.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption is somewhat misleading as it claims that 'cluster-only inputs can perform nearly as well as standard embeddings,' but the figure does not directly compare these inputs to standard embeddings. A more specific and accurate caption would focus on the performance trends of cluster-only representations across the metrics shown.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references provide a general context for the figure but lack sufficient detail about the subplots and the metrics analyzed. Adding more explicit descriptions of how each subplot supports the claim would improve the integration of the figure into the narrative."
    },
    "figure_4": {
        "Img_description": "The figure has four subplots arranged in a 2x2 grid. Each subplot represents a metric over epochs. The x-axis denotes epochs, while the y-axis reflects metrics like 'Training Loss', 'Complexity-Weighted Accuracy', etc. Two color-coded curves are presented in each plot, corresponding to different scenarios or clustering methods, but no legend is provided to clarify their exact meaning.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is well-structured and the axes are labeled clearly. However, the lack of a legend is a significant issue, as it leaves ambiguity about the meaning of the curves. The subplot titles are not descriptive enough to fully explain the experimental conditions. Adding a legend and providing more detailed annotations or summaries within each subplot would improve clarity.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption is concise but too vague to be helpful. It does not provide specific insights or guidance on how the figure supports the claim about SPR BENCH's complexity. Expanding the caption to summarize key observations and explicitly relate them to the claim would improve its utility.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure but does so in a generic manner, without detailing the specific trends or observations visible in the plots. The figrefs should be expanded to explain the figure's content more thoroughly and connect it explicitly to the claim of limited generalization in SPR BENCH."
    },
    "figure_5": {
        "Img_description": "The figure contains four subplots arranged in a 2x2 grid. Each subplot has a title indicating the evaluation metric being visualized: 'Training Loss,' 'Complexity-Weighted AUC,' 'Color-Weighted AUC,' and 'Shape-Weighted AUC.' The x-axis is consistent across all subplots but lacks explicit labeling. The y-axis varies in each subplot, corresponding to different metrics, but also lacks detailed labeling. The plots show trends or comparisons, but the absence of a legend limits interpretability.",
        "Img_review": "The figure effectively conveys the relationship between random cluster assignments and performance metrics. However, it suffers from several issues: (1) Axes are not labeled with sufficient detail, making it unclear what the x-axis represents and what units the y-axis uses. (2) A legend is missing, preventing identification of groups or data configurations. (3) The presentation could benefit from annotations or highlights to emphasize the key trends supporting the caption's claim.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption aligns with the general trends observable in the figure but fails to provide sufficient specificity or context. It is concise, which is a positive, but lacks clarity on how the figure demonstrates the dataset\u2019s susceptibility to memorization. A more detailed explanation or reference to specific trends in the figure would strengthen its effectiveness.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references are entirely missing ([ ]), leaving the figure without proper integration or explanation in the paper. The absence of these references makes it unclear how the figure supports the broader narrative or findings. The authors should include specific references and explanations for this figure in the main text to enhance its context and relevance."

    "figure_6": {
        "Img_description": "The figure consists of four subplots arranged in a 2x2 grid. Top-left: 'Shape_Based_Clustering: Training Loss' with x-axis labeled 'Epoch' and y-axis labeled 'Loss,' plotting 'Train Loss' and 'Val Loss.' Top-right: 'Shape_Based_Clustering: Complexity-Weighted Acc' with x-axis labeled 'Epoch' and y-axis labeled 'Comp Wt Acc,' plotting 'Train Comp Wt Acc' and 'Val Comp Wt Acc.' Bottom-left: 'Shape_Based_Clustering: Color-Weighted Accuracy' with x-axis labeled 'Epoch' and y-axis labeled 'Color Wt Acc,' plotting 'Train CWA' and 'Val CWA.' Bottom-right: 'Shape_Based_Clustering: Shape-Weighted Accuracy' with x-axis labeled 'Epoch' and y-axis labeled 'Shape Wt Acc,' plotting 'Train SWA' and 'Val SWA.'",
        "Img_review": "The figure provides a clear visual representation of metrics over epochs but suffers from some clarity issues. Legends overlap plot areas, reducing readability. Y-axis labels could be more descriptive (e.g., 'Comp Wt Acc' to 'Complexity-Weighted Accuracy'). Gridlines or annotations would improve interpretability. The color coding is consistent, but critical trends or insights are not highlighted.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption partially aligns with the figure. While it mentions shape-focused tasks and color granularity, the figure does not explicitly demonstrate poor color-focused performance. The caption could be revised to summarize insights from each subplot more effectively.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text lacks references to the figure, which is a critical issue. The figure's purpose and relevance to the claims made in the text are unclear without proper context or explanation."
