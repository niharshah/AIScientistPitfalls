    "Summary": "The paper explores the use of clustering techniques combined with auto-encoder embeddings to enhance Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR) on a synthetic benchmark (SPR BENCH). The method achieves near-perfect accuracy metrics, but closer analysis reveals that the improvements are largely due to superficial correlations and dataset-specific biases, rather than true generalization. The authors acknowledge these limitations but fail to propose concrete solutions.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper addresses the challenging problem of Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR), which has clear relevance in many domains.",
        "The authors conduct experiments to highlight the limitations of their method, such as sensitivity to distribution shifts and overfitting to cluster IDs."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The method achieves high accuracy on SPR BENCH, but the results are heavily dataset-specific and do not demonstrate true generalization. Random clustering also achieves high performance, indicating that the dataset is too simplistic or biased.",
        "The novelty of the proposed approach is limited, as clustering with embeddings is a well-known technique in machine learning.",
        "The paper lacks rigorous evaluation on real-world scenarios or harder datasets. No experiments on domain shifts or adversarial cases are presented, despite the authors discussing their importance.",
        "The methodology and presentation are unclear in several sections. For example, the clustering process and its impact on model performance are not described in sufficient detail.",
        "There is no meaningful theoretical contribution or insight into why the proposed method works (or fails)."

    "Questions": [
        "How does the method perform under domain shifts or adversarial examples? Can the authors provide any experiments to validate generalization beyond SPR BENCH?",
        "What justifies the use of clustering with auto-encoder embeddings in this specific context? How does it compare to other potential techniques (e.g., hierarchical clustering or graph-based approaches)?",
        "Can the authors clarify the clustering procedure and its role in the pipeline? The current description is vague and lacks technical depth."
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The method heavily relies on dataset-specific biases, as evidenced by the high performance of random clustering. This significantly limits the applicability of the results to real-world scenarios.",
        "The experimental setup does not include any evaluation of generalization, such as domain shifts or adversarial robustness, which are critical for SPR tasks.",
        "The paper lacks any substantial theoretical or practical insights into the proposed approach, leaving its contributions incremental at best."
