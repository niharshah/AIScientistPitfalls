  "current_findings": "### Comprehensive Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The successful tuning of the Adam optimizer's \u03b2\u2082 parameter demonstrated the importance of fine-tuning hyperparameters. The results showed that slight variations in \u03b2\u2082 values could lead to improvements in training and validation losses, as well as in CWA, SWA, and EWA scores.\n\n- **Disentangling Latent Attributes**: Experiments that focused on disentangling glyphs into shape and color components consistently showed improved performance. This approach allowed models to capture both structural and stylistic regularities, leading to higher accuracy scores across various metrics.\n\n- **Lightweight Models with Explicit Structure**: Using lightweight models with explicit access to latent structures, such as clustering glyphs by shape and color, proved effective. These models were parameter-efficient and capable of generalizing well to unseen data, as evidenced by high validation and test accuracies.\n\n- **Dual-Channel Representations**: Models that incorporated dual-channel representations (shape and color) and used architectures like Transformers or Bi-LSTMs to process these representations showed strong performance. This approach allowed the models to capture cross-token regularities and improve robustness-oriented metrics like PCWA.\n\n- **Avoiding Data Leakage**: Correcting the data leakage issue by constructing vocabularies strictly from the training split led to more reliable validation and test results, emphasizing the importance of proper data handling.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Overfitting on Validation Set**: Some experiments showed promising validation results but failed to generalize well to the test set. This indicates potential overfitting on the validation data, which can be mitigated by using techniques like cross-validation or regularization.\n\n- **Insufficient Exploration of Model Architectures**: While some experiments successfully used lightweight models, there is a risk of not exploring more sophisticated architectures that could potentially yield better results. Balancing model complexity with computational efficiency is crucial.\n\n- **Data Leakage**: The initial issue with test-set information leakage highlights the importance of strict data handling protocols to ensure fair evaluation and avoid artificially inflated performance metrics.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Further Hyperparameter Exploration**: Continue exploring a wider range of hyperparameters, including learning rates and optimizer settings, to identify optimal configurations for different model architectures.\n\n- **Experiment with More Complex Architectures**: While lightweight models have shown success, experimenting with more complex architectures, such as deeper Transformers or hybrid models, could provide additional insights and performance improvements.\n\n- **Implement Regularization Techniques**: To prevent overfitting, incorporate regularization techniques such as dropout, weight decay, or early stopping, especially when validation performance significantly exceeds test performance.\n\n- **Cross-Validation for Robust Evaluation**: Use cross-validation to ensure that the model's performance is consistent across different data splits, reducing the risk of overfitting to a particular validation set.\n\n- **Enhanced Clustering Techniques**: Explore more sophisticated clustering techniques that go beyond simple shape and color decompositions, potentially incorporating unsupervised learning methods to discover latent structures.\n\n- **Rigorous Data Handling**: Maintain strict data handling protocols to prevent leakage and ensure that all evaluations are fair and representative of real-world performance.\n\nBy incorporating these insights and recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes and avoid the pitfalls observed in the current experimental progress."
