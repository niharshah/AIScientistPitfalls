  "current_findings": "## Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Dual-Channel Representation**: The successful experiments often utilized a dual-channel representation, where glyphs were disentangled into shape and color components. This approach allowed the model to exploit both structural and stylistic regularities, leading to improved performance metrics, particularly in CWA, SWA, and PCWA.\n\n- **Bidirectional LSTM with Attention**: The use of a bidirectional LSTM followed by attention-style mean pooling was a common design choice that contributed to high validation and test accuracies. This architecture effectively captured sequence dependencies and enhanced the model's ability to generalize.\n\n- **Ablation Studies**: Conducting ablation studies, such as removing color embeddings or using unidirectional LSTMs, provided insights into the contributions of different components. These studies highlighted the importance of each design element and helped refine the model architecture.\n\n- **Efficient Parameter Usage**: Successful experiments maintained parameter efficiency while achieving high performance, demonstrating that well-designed architectures can balance complexity and computational cost.\n\n- **Robust Training and Evaluation Pipeline**: The experiments consistently utilized a robust pipeline for training, evaluation, and logging, ensuring that results were reproducible and comparable across different setups.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Overfitting**: Several experiments, particularly those with high validation metrics but lower test performance, indicated overfitting. This suggests that the models were too tailored to the training and validation data, failing to generalize to unseen data.\n\n- **Dataset Availability Issues**: The failed experiment due to a missing dataset folder ('SPR_COLORPERM') highlights the importance of ensuring all necessary data is available and correctly referenced in the script.\n\n- **Lack of Regularization**: The absence of regularization techniques in some experiments led to overfitting, as evidenced by the significant drop in test performance compared to validation metrics.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Incorporate Regularization Techniques**: To combat overfitting, future experiments should incorporate regularization methods such as dropout, weight decay, and early stopping. These techniques can help improve the model's generalization capabilities.\n\n- **Ensure Data Availability and Management**: Before running experiments, verify that all required datasets are available and correctly referenced in the scripts. Implement fallback mechanisms to handle missing data gracefully.\n\n- **Diversify Training Data**: Use a more diverse training set or apply data augmentation to improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. Cross-validation can also be employed to better assess the model's robustness.\n\n- **Continue Ablation Studies**: Further ablation studies can provide deeper insights into the contributions of different model components. Experiment with variations in architecture and embedding strategies to identify optimal configurations.\n\n- **Optimize Parameter Efficiency**: While maintaining high performance, continue to explore ways to optimize parameter usage, ensuring that models remain computationally efficient and scalable.\n\nBy addressing these areas, future experiments can build on the successes and learn from the failures to achieve even better performance and generalization."
