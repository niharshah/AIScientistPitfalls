    "figure_1": {
        "Img_description": "The figure consists of two empty placeholders for subplots (left and right) with no visible content such as axes, curves, or labels.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is incomplete, lacking essential graphical elements that are necessary for interpreting the results. There are no axes, data points, or labels, making it impossible to evaluate the content described in the caption or main text. Improvements are needed to include clear and complete visual data representations, such as properly labeled axes, legends, and curves.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption does not match the figure, as it describes specific content (e.g., training and validation losses, validation metrics) that is absent. The caption should be revised to accurately reflect the figure's content once the figure is corrected. Additionally, it should include a concise takeaway from the visual data.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references are detailed and attempt to connect the figure to the broader discussion of model performance. However, without valid figure content, these references fail to provide meaningful insights. Once the figure is corrected, the text should ensure that its descriptions and conclusions align with the visual data."
    },
    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The figure is split into two panels, both of which are entirely blank. The left panel is intended to show loss curves, while the right panel is meant to display validation accuracy trends. However, no visual content is present in either panel.",
        "Img_review": "The figure lacks any content, rendering it unable to convey the intended information about loss curves or validation accuracy. Essential elements such as axes, lines, legends, and annotations are missing. This makes the figure unusable in its current state. Suggested improvements include populating the figure with the appropriate data plots, ensuring proper labeling, and including a legend for clarity.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption describes trends (e.g., rapid overfitting and peaking validation accuracy) that are not observable in the empty figure. While concise and technically relevant to the described content, it does not align with the figure as presented. The caption should be revised if the figure is updated, ensuring consistency and accuracy.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure as providing a comparison for dual-channel results and claims it highlights issues with generalization and reliance on simplistic cues. However, the figure's lack of content renders these references ineffective and unsupported. The references should be revisited and adjusted once the figure is corrected and its content finalized."
