    "Summary": "The paper explores the mismatch between validation performance and real-world generalization in a color-shape matching model. It highlights how seemingly strong validation accuracy can conceal poor test performance under domain shifts. The authors propose simple experiments with baseline and dual-channel models to demonstrate the fragility of learned representations.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper addresses an important and practical issue in machine learning: the over-reliance on validation metrics as a proxy for generalization.",
        "The experiments are straightforward and easy to follow, illustrating the observed shortfall in generalization."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper lacks originality and novelty, as the problem of over-reliance on validation metrics has been well-documented in the literature.",
        "The methodology is superficial, with no significant innovations in the network design, training protocols, or experimental setups.",
        "The empirical analysis is limited to a single dataset and does not provide a broader investigation into other domains, making the conclusions less generalizable.",
        "Key experimental details, such as dataset specifics, ablation setups, and test scenarios, are relegated to the appendix and not adequately explored in the main text.",
        "There is no proposed solution or concrete recommendations to address the identified issue, limiting the impact and significance of the work."

    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not propose any concrete solutions to the identified problem, limiting its practical utility.",
        "The scope of experiments is narrow, focusing on a single dataset and failing to explore other domains or tasks.",
        "The lack of rigorous analysis and interpretability of results undermines the validity of the conclusions."
