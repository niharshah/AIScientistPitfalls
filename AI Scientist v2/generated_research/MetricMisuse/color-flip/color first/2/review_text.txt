    "Summary": "The paper explores symbolic glyph clustering for enhanced symbolic pattern recognition (SPR), proposing a pipeline involving pre-trained embeddings, K-means clustering, and a neural reasoning model. Their approach shows minor improvements on shape-based metrics but fails to improve color-based reasoning tasks, falling short of the state-of-the-art performance. The paper highlights the potential of clustering but also its limitations in handling multi-attribute symbolic reasoning.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The focus on symbolic reasoning and clustering is a relevant and challenging area.",
        "The experiments provide results on both shape- and color-based metrics, offering partial insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the approach."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The originality is limited, as the use of K-means clustering and pre-trained embeddings is a standard approach.",
        "The empirical results are weak, with only minor improvements on shape-based metrics and failure to surpass state-of-the-art performance on color-based tasks.",
        "The analysis is insufficient; the reasons behind the partial success or failure of the proposed method are not clearly explained.",
        "The methodology lacks sufficient detail, particularly in how clustering interacts with the reasoning model, making reproducibility challenging.",
        "The contributions are incremental and do not advance the state of the art meaningfully.",
        "The paper does not provide comparisons with robust baselines or alternative clustering methods, limiting the significance of the results."

    "Questions": [
        "Why does clustering fail to improve performance on color-based tasks? Can the authors provide insights or propose specific reasons?",
        "How does the pipeline handle the interaction between clustering and reasoning, particularly for multi-attribute tasks?",
        "Have the authors considered alternative clustering methods or more advanced clustering algorithms beyond K-means? If not, why not?",
        "How does the proposed method compare to state-of-the-art neural-symbolic approaches or other SPR benchmarks?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not address the limitations of K-means clustering in high-dimensional symbolic reasoning tasks.",
        "The proposed methodology does not explore alternative approaches to improve multi-attribute reasoning.",
        "The paper fails to robustly evaluate or interpret the failures on color-weighted tasks, missing an opportunity to provide actionable insights for the field."
