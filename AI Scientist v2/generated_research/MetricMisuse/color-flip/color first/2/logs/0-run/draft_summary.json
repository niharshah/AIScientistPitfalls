  "Experiment_description": "Multiple experiments were conducted to evaluate different approaches for classifying symbols based on shape, color, and complexity. The experiments ranged from a baseline model using bag-of-glyph features and a simple MLP to more complex models employing latent factor embeddings and clustering methods.",
  "Significance": "The experiments provide critical insights into effectively using feature representation and clustering for symbol classification tasks. They highlight the potential for improved performance through advanced feature extraction techniques and clustering, which could impact future work in symbol recognition and related fields.",
  "Description": "The experiments involved loading symbol datasets, extracting features, and classifying these using neural networks. The baseline model used a simple feature representation, while subsequent models incorporated latent embeddings and clustering to enhance performance. Metrics such as Color-Weighted Accuracy, Shape-Weighted Accuracy, and Glyph-Complexity-Weighted Accuracy were used to evaluate performance.",
