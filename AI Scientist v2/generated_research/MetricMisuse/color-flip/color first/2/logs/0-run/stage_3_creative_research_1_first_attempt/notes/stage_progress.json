  "current_findings": "### Comprehensive Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Embedding Dimension Tuning**: Iterating over different embedding dimensions (4, 8, 16, 32, 64) showed improvements in validation metrics, indicating that hyperparameter tuning is crucial for optimizing model performance. The experiments successfully recorded and saved metrics for further analysis.\n\n- **Transformer Architectures**: Incorporating Transformer encoders, either standalone or in combination with other architectures like Conv1D, consistently improved the ability to capture long-range dependencies and cross-token interactions. This was evident in the improved validation metrics across multiple experiments.\n\n- **Hybrid Models**: Combining different architectural components, such as Transformers with Conv1D stacks, allowed models to reason about both local and global patterns, leading to high validation performance. This hybrid approach showed promise in improving specific metrics like SWA.\n\n- **Auxiliary Tasks**: Introducing multi-task objectives, such as predicting color and shape counts alongside the main task, helped bias the model towards features that matter for weighted metrics, resulting in improved validation performance.\n\n- **Minimal Invasive Changes**: Making small, semantically meaningful changes, such as adding global variety-aware features, proved effective in enhancing model performance without overhauling the entire pipeline.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Synthetic Data Generation Errors**: A recurring issue was the incorrect use of the `load_dataset` function, which led to FileNotFoundErrors. This was due to attempts to load JSON data from in-memory Python dictionaries instead of file paths.\n\n- **Overfitting and Generalization Issues**: Several experiments showed high validation performance but significantly lower test performance, indicating potential overfitting or distributional differences between validation and test sets.\n\n- **High Test Loss**: Some experiments reported high test loss, which suggests that the models struggled with generalization. This could be due to inadequate training data, insufficient regularization, or suboptimal model architectures.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Continue focusing on hyperparameter tuning, especially for embedding dimensions and clustering parameters, to optimize model performance.\n\n- **Improved Data Handling**: Address synthetic data generation issues by using `datasets.Dataset.from_dict()` to create datasets directly from Python dictionaries, avoiding reliance on file paths.\n\n- **Regularization Techniques**: Implement regularization techniques such as dropout or weight decay to mitigate overfitting and improve generalization.\n\n- **Model Architecture Exploration**: Explore alternate model architectures, such as more complex Transformer models or hybrid architectures, to better capture relationships among glyphs.\n\n- **Data Augmentation**: Consider augmenting the training data or using data augmentation techniques to improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.\n\n- **Investigate Validation-Test Discrepancies**: Conduct a thorough analysis of the validation-test performance gap to identify potential distributional differences and address them.\n\nBy leveraging these insights from both successful and failed experiments, future research can build more robust models that achieve state-of-the-art performance on both validation and test sets."
