  "current_findings": "### Comprehensive Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Data Handling and Flexibility**: Successful experiments demonstrate robust data handling by providing fallback mechanisms. For instance, if the official dataset is missing, a synthetic dataset is generated, ensuring the experiment runs end-to-end without interruption.\n\n- **Model Design and Simplicity**: The use of lightweight models, such as small MLPs, proves effective. These models are simple yet powerful enough to achieve high accuracy metrics, particularly when combined with effective feature extraction techniques like clustering and embedding.\n\n- **Feature Extraction**: Parsing symbols into discrete latent factors (shape, color, cluster) and using these for feature extraction is a recurring theme. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding and classification of glyphs, leading to better performance.\n\n- **Metric Tracking**: Successful experiments consistently track a variety of metrics, including Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), and Glyph-Complexity-Weighted Accuracy (GCWA). This comprehensive evaluation helps in understanding different aspects of model performance.\n\n- **Self-Contained Code**: Ensuring that the code is self-contained and can run independently of external dependencies is a key success factor. This includes automatic GPU detection and usage, which optimizes computational efficiency.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **File Handling Errors**: A major failure pattern is the occurrence of FileNotFoundError due to incorrect dataset paths. This indicates a lack of robustness in handling file paths and dataset availability.\n\n- **Dataset Dependency**: Experiments that fail often depend heavily on the presence of specific datasets without fallback options. This dependency can halt the entire process if the dataset is not found.\n\n- **Lack of Error Handling**: The absence of comprehensive error handling mechanisms leads to execution failures. This includes not verifying the existence of necessary files before attempting to load them.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Data Robustness**: Implement robust data handling techniques by ensuring that the code can handle missing datasets gracefully. This could involve checking for file existence before loading and providing clear instructions for dataset placement.\n\n- **Improve Error Handling**: Incorporate comprehensive error handling to catch and manage exceptions like FileNotFoundError. This will prevent abrupt terminations and provide clearer guidance for troubleshooting.\n\n- **Optimize Model Simplicity and Efficiency**: Continue leveraging lightweight models with effective feature extraction methods. Consider exploring additional latent factors or alternative clustering techniques to further enhance model performance.\n\n- **Ensure Code Self-Containment**: Maintain the self-contained nature of the code, ensuring it can run independently of external dependencies. This includes automatic resource management, such as GPU usage.\n\n- **Comprehensive Metric Evaluation**: Continue tracking a wide range of metrics to gain a holistic view of model performance. Consider adding new metrics that could provide additional insights into specific aspects of the model's capabilities.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes and avoid the pitfalls observed in current and past attempts."
