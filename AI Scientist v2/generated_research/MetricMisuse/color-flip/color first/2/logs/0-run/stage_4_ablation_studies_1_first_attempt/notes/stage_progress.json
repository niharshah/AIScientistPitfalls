  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **BiLSTM Utilization**: The use of a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) was a key factor in the success of the baseline design. It effectively captured richer sequential representations, which contributed to high validation and test accuracies.\n\n- **Glyph Clustering**: Incorporating unsupervised glyph clustering (using K-means) alongside shape and color embeddings improved the model's performance. This approach allowed the model to leverage additional structural information without incurring extra training costs.\n\n- **Consistent Evaluation and Logging**: Successful experiments consistently computed and logged metrics such as color-weighted accuracy (CWA), shape-weighted accuracy (SWA), and glyph complexity-weighted accuracy (GCWA) at every epoch. This practice ensured comprehensive performance tracking and facilitated comparisons across different experimental setups.\n\n- **Ablation Studies**: Conducting ablation studies (e.g., No-Cluster-Embedding, No-Color-Embedding) helped identify the contributions of individual components to the overall model performance. This approach provided insights into which elements were critical for success.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Simplified Models**: Ablations that removed key components, such as the LSTM (Bag-of-Glyph-Pooling) or color embeddings (No-Color-Embedding), generally led to decreased performance. These simplified models failed to capture the necessary complexity of the data, resulting in higher test losses and lower accuracies.\n\n- **Random Cluster Assignments**: Replacing K-means clustering with random cluster assignments led to a slight decrease in performance, highlighting the importance of meaningful clustering in capturing the structure of the data.\n\n- **Single-Directional LSTM**: Using a unidirectional LSTM instead of a bidirectional one resulted in poorer performance, suggesting that the ability to process information in both directions is crucial for capturing the full context of the sequences.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Sequential Modeling**: Continue leveraging BiLSTM architectures for sequential data processing. Consider experimenting with more advanced sequence models like Transformers to potentially capture even richer representations.\n\n- **Refine Clustering Techniques**: Explore alternative clustering methods or hybrid approaches that combine K-means with other techniques to enhance the quality of glyph clustering. This could lead to better structural understanding and improved model performance.\n\n- **Comprehensive Ablation Studies**: Conduct further ablation studies to systematically evaluate the impact of each component. This will help identify potential areas for improvement and ensure that all elements contribute positively to the model's performance.\n\n- **Experiment with Fusion Techniques**: Investigate different methods of embedding fusion, such as weighted sums or attention mechanisms, to optimize the integration of shape, color, and cluster information.\n\n- **Robust Evaluation Framework**: Maintain a robust evaluation framework with consistent logging of key metrics. This will facilitate better tracking of progress and enable more informed decisions based on empirical evidence.\n\nBy building on these insights and recommendations, future experiments can continue to improve model performance and contribute to a deeper understanding of the underlying data structures."
