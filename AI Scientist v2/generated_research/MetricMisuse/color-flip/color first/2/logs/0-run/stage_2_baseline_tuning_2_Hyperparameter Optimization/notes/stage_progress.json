  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Successful experiments often involved systematic hyperparameter tuning, such as varying batch sizes, embedding dimensions, hidden dimensions, and weight decay. This approach allowed for the identification of optimal configurations that improved model performance on validation sets.\n\n- **Data Management and Logging**: Consistent logging of training, validation, and test metrics, as well as saving experiment data in structured formats (e.g., `experiment_data.npy`), facilitated thorough analysis and comparison of results across different configurations.\n\n- **Bug Fixes and Code Corrections**: Addressing specific bugs, such as the pooling bug in the GlyphModel, led to improvements in model performance. Ensuring that operations like broadcasting and tensor dimension alignment were correctly implemented was crucial for successful execution.\n\n- **Validation-Test Gap Focus**: Many experiments highlighted a focus on addressing the performance gap between validation and test metrics. This awareness is crucial for developing models that generalize well to unseen data.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Tensor Dimension Mismatches**: A recurring issue in failed experiments was mismatches in tensor dimensions during the forward pass, often due to incorrect padding or masking logic. This suggests a need for careful attention to tensor operations and alignment.\n\n- **Variable Length Sequences**: Handling variable-length input sequences was a common source of errors, particularly in the collate function and during pooling operations. Ensuring consistent dimensions across batches is essential to avoid runtime errors.\n\n- **Overfitting**: Although not explicitly stated as a failure, the significant performance gap between validation and test metrics in successful experiments indicates potential overfitting. This suggests a need for more robust regularization techniques.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Regularization Techniques**: To address overfitting and improve test performance, consider implementing regularization methods such as dropout, L2 regularization, or data augmentation.\n\n- **Improve Padding and Masking Logic**: Ensure that padding and masking operations are correctly implemented to handle variable-length sequences. This includes verifying tensor dimensions before operations and ensuring proper broadcasting.\n\n- **Implement Early Stopping with Care**: While early stopping is a useful technique, ensure that it is implemented with a focus on the correct metric (e.g., validation GCWA) and that the best-performing model is properly checkpointed.\n\n- **Conduct More Comprehensive Hyperparameter Sweeps**: Expand hyperparameter tuning to include a wider range of values and combinations. This could uncover more optimal configurations that improve both validation and test performance.\n\n- **Focus on Generalization**: Design experiments with a focus on reducing the validation-test performance gap. This could involve using cross-validation techniques or additional validation datasets to better estimate model generalization.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations and learning from both successful and failed experiments, future research can achieve more robust and generalizable model performance."
