        "Img_description": "The figure contains two subfigures: (a) shows baseline dimension tuning results with a line plot and bar graph summarizing performance metrics for embedding dimensions (4\u201364), and (b) presents enhanced BiLSTM + clustering results using line plots and bar graphs to compare shape-weighted and color-weighted accuracy.",
        "Img_review": "The figure includes relevant comparative analyses but suffers from unclear labeling. Axis titles, legends, and annotations are not legible, which makes interpreting the exact results challenging. Improvements in labeling and annotations would enhance clarity and usability.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption broadly matches the figure's content but is too vague. It should explicitly describe trends or numerical insights, such as the exact impact of embedding dimensions or performance gains from clustering. Including concise takeaways would improve its utility.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The references to the figure in the text provide a reasonable context but lack integration with the figure's specific details. For instance, embedding dimension impacts and clustering improvements should be explicitly linked to the trends visible in the figure. This would improve the figure's explanatory power."
    },
    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The figure consists of eight sub-panels labeled (a) through (h), showcasing ablation studies for different configurations. Some panels feature line plots (e.g., performance over epochs or iterations), while others include bar charts or heatmaps, likely comparing metrics or embeddings. The exact axes, legends, and labels are small and difficult to discern.",
        "Img_review": "The figure's resolution is low, making it hard to interpret the axes and legends. Each sub-panel lacks a descriptive title or in-depth annotation, which would help clarify the analysis. Overall, the figure is informative but requires better visual clarity and labeling to improve interpretability.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption describes the configurations tested but does not summarize the observed results or trends. It could be improved by including a concise takeaway about the ablation studies and their impact on performance.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references provide context about the figure but do not explicitly describe the trends or specific results shown in each subfigure. Explicitly pointing to specific panels and observations would better integrate the figure into the text."
