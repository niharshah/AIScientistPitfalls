        "Img_description": "The figure is a placeholder with no visible content, axes, or data points. It appears incomplete or missing.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is entirely missing, as only a placeholder is visible. This makes it impossible to analyze or draw any conclusions. The authors must include the actual figure, which could visually showcase the accuracy fluctuations described in the caption.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption describes a specific phenomenon (accuracy fluctuations across runs with data augmentation). However, without an actual figure, it is impossible to determine if it aligns with the visual content. The caption seems appropriately concise but requires a supporting figure to validate its claims.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The figure references in the main text are missing, as denoted by the placeholder []. The lack of references prevents understanding the intended context or purpose of the figure. The authors need to provide meaningful and explanatory references to integrate the figure into the text."
    },
    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The figure is entirely blank, with no visible content, axes, labels, or plots.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is completely devoid of content, making it impossible to analyze or interpret scientifically. No axes, legends, or other visual elements are present. Suggestions for improvement: include data, plots, or visualizations that support the claims in the caption. Ensure proper annotations, such as axis labels, legends, and titles, to enhance clarity.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption ('Several attempted fixes only partially resolved training instabilities') does not align with the figure, as the latter is blank and provides no evidence or context to support the claim. The caption should be revised to match the content of the figure, or the figure should be populated with relevant data and visualizations.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The figure references in the main text are missing ('[]'). As a result, there is no explanation or contextualization of the figure's purpose or content. This significantly detracts from its usefulness. Proper figrefs should be added to discuss the figure's intended message, context, and relevance to the paper\u2019s narrative."
    },
    "figure_3": {
        "Img_description": "The figure appears to be blank or empty, with no visible elements such as labeled axes, graphs, or data points.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is incomplete as it lacks any meaningful visual content. To improve, add a plot or graph that reflects the trends described in the caption. Ensure proper labeling of axes and include a legend if needed.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption claims that performance occasionally improved early in training but plateaued unpredictably. However, the figure does not contain any content to support this claim. The caption should be rewritten to correspond to an updated figure that accurately visualizes the described trends.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references are missing or empty. There is no integration of the figure into the narrative, and its purpose is not explained. The references should clearly describe the figure's content, context, and relevance."

    "figure_4": {
        "Img_description": "The figure is blank and contains no discernible data, graphical elements, or visualizations. It only contains placeholder text.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is incomplete and does not include any information to support its intended purpose. To improve, it should include relevant visual data or graphical representations related to domain adaptation tasks, such as performance metrics or comparative results under varying conditions. Proper labeling of axes, legends, and annotations should be added.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption, 'Minimal progress in domain adaptation tasks when data distributions varied significantly,' is not supported by the figure, as no data is present. While the caption is concise, it could benefit from more detail about what the figure should convey. For example, specify metrics or comparisons that are expected to be shown.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The references in the main text describe the intended purpose of Figure 4, indicating it should illustrate minimal gains in domain adaptation under altered conditions. However, due to the lack of content in the figure, these references cannot be adequately assessed or validated. The text references are clear but disconnected from the provided image."
