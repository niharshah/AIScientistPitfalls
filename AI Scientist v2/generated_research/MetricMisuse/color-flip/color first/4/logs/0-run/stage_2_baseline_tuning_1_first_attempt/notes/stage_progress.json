  "current_findings": "## Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Effective Bug Fixes**: The successful experiments demonstrated a strong ability to identify and fix bugs, such as the issue with the `stoi` dictionary. By keeping a copy of the original dictionary and building a direct `token_to_cluster` mapping before reassigning `stoi`, the experiments avoided KeyErrors and maintained functionality.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic hyperparameter tuning was a key factor in achieving high performance. Experiments that involved tuning parameters like epochs, learning rate, batch size, and RNN hidden dimensions showed significant improvements in model accuracy and loss metrics. The use of grid-search and careful logging of results allowed for effective optimization.\n\n- **Integration of Clustering**: The integration of latent-clustering steps after the first epoch in various experiments contributed to improved results. This step was consistently applied across different hyperparameter settings, indicating its importance in the training pipeline.\n\n- **Consistent Logging and Data Storage**: Successful experiments consistently logged training and validation metrics and stored them in a structured format. This practice facilitated easy analysis and comparison of results across different experimental conditions.\n\n- **Achievement of High Accuracy**: Across various experiments, the models achieved exceptionally high accuracy metrics, often surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks. This was particularly evident in metrics like Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) and Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA).\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Overwriting Critical Variables**: The initial bug with the `stoi` dictionary highlights the risk of overwriting critical variables before their intended use. Ensuring that key data structures are preserved or correctly updated is crucial.\n\n- **Inadequate Hyperparameter Exploration**: While not explicitly mentioned as a failure, the success of hyperparameter tuning suggests that inadequate exploration of hyperparameter space could lead to suboptimal model performance.\n\n- **Lack of Error Handling**: Although successful experiments did not encounter errors, the absence of detailed error handling mechanisms could pose risks in more complex or varied experimental settings.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Preserve Critical Data Structures**: Always ensure that critical data structures, such as dictionaries or mappings, are preserved or correctly updated throughout the experiment to avoid errors like KeyErrors.\n\n- **Comprehensive Hyperparameter Tuning**: Continue to employ systematic hyperparameter tuning using grid-search or other optimization techniques. Consider expanding the range of hyperparameters explored to uncover potentially better-performing configurations.\n\n- **Maintain Consistent Logging**: Keep up the practice of detailed logging and structured data storage. This will facilitate easier analysis and comparison of results, as well as provide a clear record of experimental progress.\n\n- **Integrate Clustering Steps**: Continue to integrate clustering steps into the training pipeline, as they have consistently contributed to improved performance.\n\n- **Implement Robust Error Handling**: Develop and implement robust error handling mechanisms to anticipate and manage potential issues in more complex experimental setups.\n\nBy adhering to these recommendations and learning from both successes and potential pitfalls, future experiments can continue to achieve high performance and contribute valuable insights to the field."
