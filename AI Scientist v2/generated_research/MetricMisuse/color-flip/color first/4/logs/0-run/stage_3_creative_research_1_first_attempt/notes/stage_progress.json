  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Successful experiments consistently implemented hyperparameter tuning, particularly focusing on learning rates. A small sweep over learning rates (e.g., {5e-4, 8e-4, 1.5e-3, 2e-3}) was effective in optimizing model performance, with higher learning rates often yielding better results.\n\n- **Clustering and Vocabulary Reduction:** The integration of clustering techniques, such as K-means, to reduce vocabulary size proved beneficial. This approach allowed models to focus on rule reasoning rather than surface form variety, enhancing accuracy and generalization.\n\n- **Self-Contained and Robust Scripts:** Successful experiments were designed to be self-contained, with synthetic datasets generated when real data was unavailable. This ensured that experiments could run consistently across different environments.\n\n- **Efficient Use of Resources:** Experiments that utilized GPU support effectively and completed within a reasonable time frame (e.g., under 30 minutes) showed better performance and reliability.\n\n- **Metric Tracking and Reporting:** Comprehensive tracking and reporting of metrics, including Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), and Complexity-Weighted Accuracy (CompWA), were crucial for evaluating model performance and guiding further improvements.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Incorrect Handling of Cluster Sizes:** Several failures arose from incorrect handling of cluster sizes, such as setting the number of clusters beyond the valid range for silhouette scoring or mismatches in embedding dimensions after clustering.\n\n- **Index and Dimension Errors:** Errors such as IndexError and RuntimeError were common, often due to assumptions about token lengths or mismatches in tensor dimensions during model initialization or state reloading.\n\n- **Improper Tensor Operations:** Attempting operations on tensors that require gradients without detaching them from the computation graph led to failures. Proper detachment is necessary before converting tensors to NumPy arrays.\n\n- **State Management Issues:** Saving and reloading model states without accounting for changes in vocabulary size after clustering led to mismatches and failures in model initialization.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Refine Hyperparameter Tuning:** Continue to explore and refine hyperparameter tuning, especially learning rates, as they have shown significant impact on model performance. Consider expanding the range of hyperparameters being tuned.\n\n- **Enhance Clustering Techniques:** Ensure that clustering techniques are robust and account for valid ranges in metrics like silhouette score. Consider dynamic adjustments to cluster sizes based on dataset characteristics.\n\n- **Improve Error Handling:** Implement thorough error handling and validation checks, particularly for indexing and dimension operations. This can prevent common runtime errors and improve the robustness of the experiments.\n\n- **Optimize State Management:** Develop a systematic approach for managing model states, especially when changes in vocabulary or embedding dimensions occur. This includes updating models before saving states and ensuring compatibility during reloading.\n\n- **Leverage Advanced Architectures:** Explore the integration of advanced architectures, such as attention mechanisms, to further enhance pattern discovery and model performance.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations and learning from both successful and failed experiments, future research can achieve more consistent and reliable outcomes in Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning and related tasks."
