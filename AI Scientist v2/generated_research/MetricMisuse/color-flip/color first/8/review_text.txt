    "Summary": "The paper explores the use of symbolic proxies for relational reasoning tasks under real-world conditions. It identifies several pitfalls and reports mixed or negative results, highlighting issues with robustness and generalization. The paper aims to shed light on the limitations of these methods and suggests future directions for improvement.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper addresses an important problem: understanding the limitations of symbolic proxies in relational reasoning tasks.",
        "It highlights the fragility of these methods under domain shifts and realistic conditions, which is a valid and relevant concern."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper is poorly written and lacks clarity. There is little to no detail provided about the experimental setup, datasets, baselines, or evaluation metrics.",
        "The results are largely negative or inconclusive, but the paper fails to provide meaningful analysis, interpretations, or actionable insights from these results.",
        "There are no references provided to prior work, making it difficult to verify or contextualize the claims made in the paper.",
        "The contribution is minimal, as the work does not propose new methods, frameworks, or theoretical advancements. It merely reports limitations without adequately exploring or addressing them.",
        "Figures and analyses in the paper are insufficient and lack explanatory depth. For example, the confusion matrix and training curves are briefly mentioned but not discussed in detail.",
        "The supplementary material is mentioned but not provided, leaving critical details about ablations and domain-specific considerations unexplored."

    "Questions": [
        "What datasets were used, and how were they chosen to evaluate the limitations of symbolic proxies?",
        "How do the results compare to existing baselines or alternative approaches for relational reasoning?",
        "What precisely are the 'symbolic proxies' and the downstream rule modules described in Section 3? Please provide more details about their implementation.",
        "Can the authors provide concrete examples of the domain shifts or edge cases where the method failed?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not adequately address the limitations of its own experimental setup or provide actionable recommendations for improving the robustness of symbolic proxies.",
        "Potential societal impacts or broader implications of these findings are not discussed, even though robustness issues could have critical consequences in real-world applications."
