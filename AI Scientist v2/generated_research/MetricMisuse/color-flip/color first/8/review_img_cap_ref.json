        "Img_description": "The figure consists of three panels labeled (a) Training loss, (b) Validation metrics, and (c) Confusion matrix. The panels contain placeholder images with filenames, preventing observation of actual data or trends.",
        "Img_review": "The figure lacks actual content in the panels, making it impossible to evaluate its alignment with the caption or the text references. To improve, the actual plots or visualizations must be included, with clear labeling, legends, and axis details where applicable.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption claims that symbolic proxies initially show promise but fail to generalize, with specific issues in training curves, metrics, and errors. While concise, it is overly assertive without visible evidence. It could be improved by being more neutral and summarizing the content of each panel separately.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The figure references in the text summarize experimental findings but do not adequately describe the figure's content. They lack explicit linkage to individual panels and fail to clarify how the figure supports the conclusions. More detailed and specific references are needed."
