  "current_findings": "## Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Successful experiments often involved systematic hyperparameter tuning, such as adjusting the number of epochs, learning rates, batch sizes, hidden dimensions, weight decay, dropout rates, and activation functions. This methodical approach allowed for the identification of optimal configurations that improved model performance.\n\n- **Early Stopping**: Implementing early stopping based on key metrics, such as the Color-Shape Harmonic Mean (CSHM), helped prevent overfitting and ensured that models were trained efficiently without unnecessary epochs.\n\n- **Synthetic Data Utilization**: In the absence of the real SPR_BENCH dataset, generating synthetic data ensured that experiments could be conducted end-to-end without interruption. This approach maintained the continuity of research and allowed for the testing of various configurations.\n\n- **Consistent Metric Tracking**: The consistent tracking of metrics such as training loss, validation loss, color-weighted accuracy (CWA), shape-weighted accuracy (SWA), and their harmonic mean (CSHM) provided a comprehensive view of model performance and facilitated informed decision-making.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Suboptimal Performance Metrics**: Despite successful execution, many experiments did not surpass the state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks for CWA and SWA. This indicates that while the experiments were methodically conducted, the models or configurations used were not sufficiently advanced to achieve superior performance.\n\n- **Limited Dataset Impact**: The reliance on synthetic data due to the unavailability of the real dataset may have limited the generalizability and applicability of the results. This could have contributed to the inability to achieve SOTA benchmarks.\n\n- **Overfitting Risks**: While early stopping was employed, there is still a risk of overfitting, especially when models are trained for extended periods or with large hidden dimensions without adequate regularization.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Access to Real Dataset**: Efforts should be made to obtain the real SPR_BENCH dataset to ensure that experiments are conducted on data that closely resembles the intended application domain. This could lead to more realistic performance evaluations and potentially better results.\n\n- **Advanced Model Architectures**: Consider exploring more advanced model architectures, such as deeper neural networks, transformer-based models, or ensemble methods, to potentially surpass current performance benchmarks.\n\n- **Regularization Techniques**: Implement additional regularization techniques, such as L2 regularization, dropout, or data augmentation, to mitigate overfitting and improve model generalization.\n\n- **Comprehensive Hyperparameter Search**: Expand the hyperparameter search space to include more diverse configurations and consider using automated hyperparameter optimization tools to efficiently explore this space.\n\n- **Benchmark Comparisons**: Continuously compare experimental results against SOTA benchmarks and iteratively refine models and configurations based on these comparisons.\n\nBy addressing these areas, future experiments can build on the successes and learn from the failures to achieve more robust and competitive results."
