  "current_findings": "### Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Sequential Modeling with Bi-GRU**: The use of a bidirectional GRU (bi-GRU) has consistently shown strong performance in capturing sequential patterns, as evidenced by high validation metrics (CWA, SWA, and harmonic mean) in the baseline and several ablation studies.\n  \n- **Incorporation of Global Features**: The inclusion of shape-variety and color-variety features, when not ablated, contributes positively to model performance, as seen in the baseline experiment where these features are used.\n\n- **K-Means Clustering**: The application of K-Means clustering to transform glyphs into cluster tokens has been effective in improving the model's ability to generalize within known clusters, as demonstrated by high validation scores in experiments where K-Means is used.\n\n- **Early Stopping and Metric Monitoring**: The use of early stopping based on the harmonic mean of CWA and SWA, along with monitoring OCGA, has been effective in preventing overfitting and ensuring robust model performance.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Out-of-Cluster Generalization (OCGA)**: A recurring issue across experiments is the model's inability to generalize to unseen clusters, as indicated by consistently low OCGA scores. This suggests a limitation in the model's ability to handle novel data.\n\n- **Ablation of Key Components**: Experiments that remove critical components, such as the shape-color variety features or the bidirectional nature of the GRU, generally result in reduced performance, highlighting the importance of these components.\n\n- **Random Cluster Assignment**: Replacing semantic clustering with random assignment significantly degrades performance, underscoring the importance of meaningful clustering in the preprocessing step.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance OCGA**: Future work should focus on improving the model's ability to generalize to new clusters. This could involve exploring alternative clustering techniques or incorporating additional features that capture more nuanced patterns.\n\n- **Experiment with Different Sequence Models**: While the bi-GRU has been effective, exploring other sequence models such as Transformers or LSTMs might provide further improvements, especially in handling longer sequences or more complex dependencies.\n\n- **Feature Engineering**: Continue to explore and incorporate additional global features that might capture other aspects of the data, potentially improving the model's robustness and generalization capabilities.\n\n- **Data Augmentation**: Implementing data augmentation strategies could help improve the model's ability to generalize, particularly in scenarios where data is limited or imbalanced.\n\n- **Hybrid Clustering Approaches**: Consider hybrid approaches that combine K-Means with other clustering techniques to capture both global and local data structures more effectively.\n\nBy addressing these areas, future experiments can build on the successes and learn from the failures to develop more robust and generalizable models."
