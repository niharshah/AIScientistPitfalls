  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Early Stopping and Metric Monitoring**: Successful experiments consistently employed early stopping based on the harmonic mean of Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) and Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA). This approach effectively prevented overfitting and ensured the model's performance was optimized during training.\n\n- **Synthetic Data Utilization**: The experiments were designed to fall back on synthetic data when the real SPR_BENCH dataset was unavailable. This ensured that the experiments could be executed consistently and allowed for rapid prototyping and testing.\n\n- **Clustering and Feature Enrichment**: Many successful experiments involved clustering glyphs using methods like K-means to capture latent groupings. Enriching feature vectors with cluster histograms and raw shape/color histograms improved model performance.\n\n- **Lightweight Sequence Models**: Transitioning from simple histogram-based models to lightweight sequence-aware models, such as those using GRUs or small transformers, allowed for capturing sequential patterns and improved accuracy.\n\n- **Comprehensive Metric Tracking**: Successful experiments tracked a wide range of metrics, including training/validation loss, CWA, SWA, and Out-of-Cluster Generalization Accuracy (OCGA), providing a holistic view of model performance.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **OCGA Calculation Issues**: A recurring issue in failed experiments was the calculation of OCGA, which often resulted in 'nan' values due to division by zero errors. This occurred when there were no sequences in the test set containing unseen clusters.\n\n- **Insufficient Clustering and Feature Extraction**: Some experiments suffered from poor clustering or feature extraction, leading to suboptimal model performance. This was evident in low CWA and SWA scores, far below SOTA benchmarks.\n\n- **Model Complexity and Generalization**: Overly simplistic models failed to generalize well, particularly in handling sequences with unseen clusters, as indicated by consistently low OCGA scores.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Robust OCGA Implementation**: Implement a robust OCGA calculation method that handles cases where no unseen clusters are present in a split. This can be achieved by introducing checks to prevent division by zero and ensuring the metric is meaningful.\n\n- **Enhanced Clustering Techniques**: Experiment with different clustering algorithms or refine hyperparameters to improve the separation and representation of glyph clusters. This could involve using more advanced techniques like hierarchical clustering or Gaussian Mixture Models.\n\n- **Advanced Feature Extraction**: Consider leveraging pre-trained embeddings or more sophisticated neural architectures for feature extraction. This could involve using models like BERT or CNNs to capture more complex patterns.\n\n- **Model Architecture Exploration**: Explore deeper or more complex models, such as transformers or LSTMs, to better capture relationships in the data. This could improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.\n\n- **Data Augmentation and Expansion**: If feasible, increase the amount of training data through data augmentation techniques or by sourcing additional datasets. This could help improve model generalization and performance.\n\n- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging to quickly identify and address issues during execution, particularly in the evaluation phase.\n\nBy addressing these areas, future experiments can build on the successes observed while mitigating the common pitfalls encountered in failed attempts."
