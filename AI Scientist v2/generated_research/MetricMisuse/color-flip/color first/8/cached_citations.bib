% This foundational work by J. Hartigan and M. A. Wong (1979) introduces the K-means clustering algorithm, which is employed in the proposed methodology for clustering symbolic glyphs based on latent feature representations. This citation will be used to credit the origins of the K-means algorithm and provide theoretical background for the clustering step in the experiments.

% This paper introduces Prototypical Networks, a foundational methodology for few-shot learning. It demonstrates how clustering in a learned metric space can enable effective classification in limited-data regimes. This citation is relevant for grounding the use of clustering in the symbolic glyph reasoning task and will be cited when discussing the theoretical and practical benefits of clustering for enhancing model performance in SPR.

% This paper introduces semi-lexical languages as a framework for unifying machine learning and symbolic reasoning, particularly in computer vision tasks. Its relevance lies in its exploration of how symbolic reasoning can complement machine learning to enhance interpretability and robustness, which directly supports the discussion of integrating clustering and reasoning in SPR. This citation will be used in the related work section to provide theoretical context for the proposed symbolic reasoning framework.

% Paper 0 provides a general application of the silhouette score method for evaluating clustering quality, which supports its use in the proposed methodology to validate glyph clustering. Paper 1 discusses a specific implementation of clustering evaluation using the silhouette score, further justifying its application in the methodology for symbolic glyph clustering. These citations will be referenced in the methodology section to provide theoretical backing for evaluating clustering quality in the SPR task.
