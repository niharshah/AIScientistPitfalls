  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Symbolic Glyph Clustering**: The initial design involving symbolic glyph clustering before reasoning proved effective. This approach involved replacing glyphs with cluster IDs, transforming sequences into short integer lists, and training a GRU encoder on these clustered sequences. This method consistently delivered high validation metrics and a fully functional baseline.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic hyperparameter tuning, such as varying hidden sizes and embedding dimensions, led to improvements in validation metrics. For instance, increasing the hidden size and embedding dimensions generally improved validation performance, indicating the importance of exploring different configurations.\n\n- **Data Pipeline Adjustments**: Fixing data pipeline issues, such as correctly passing `collate_fn` by keyword and moving tensor-to-device logic into training loops, resulted in smoother execution and improved metric tracking. This highlights the importance of adhering to best practices in data handling and processing.\n\n- **Metric Tracking and Evaluation**: Consistent tracking of metrics like Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), and their harmonic mean (DWHS) provided a comprehensive evaluation framework. This allowed for clear insights into model performance across different aspects.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **DataLoader Misconfigurations**: A recurring issue was the incorrect use of the `DataLoader` parameters, particularly the conflict between using a sampler and enabling shuffle. This led to errors that halted the experiments.\n\n- **Serialization Issues**: The use of non-pickleable objects, such as lambda functions, in data structures that required serialization caused PicklingErrors. This prevented the saving of experiment data and highlighted the need for careful consideration of data structures used in experiments.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Refine Data Handling**: Ensure that all data handling and processing steps follow best practices, particularly when using frameworks like PyTorch. Avoid common pitfalls such as conflicting DataLoader parameters and ensure that all components are compatible with GPU execution.\n\n- **Explore Advanced Hyperparameter Tuning**: While initial hyperparameter tuning showed improvements, further exploration with more sophisticated techniques, such as Bayesian optimization or grid search, could yield better configurations and performance.\n\n- **Enhance Serialization Practices**: Avoid using non-pickleable objects in experiment data structures. Instead, use standard Python functions or ensure that all components are compatible with serialization to prevent errors during data saving.\n\n- **Focus on Comprehensive Metric Evaluation**: Continue to use a diverse set of metrics for evaluation, as this provides a more holistic view of model performance. Consider adding additional metrics if new aspects of performance become relevant.\n\n- **Iterate on Successful Designs**: Build upon successful designs, such as the symbolic glyph clustering approach, by exploring more sophisticated variants or integrating additional features that could enhance performance.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations and learning from both successes and failures, future experiments can be more robust, efficient, and insightful."
