  "Experiment_description": "Experiments involve processing symbolic glyph sequences using vector representations and clustering. Node c600de5f242c47ecac70675062d32eda uses a histogram and MLP classifier approach, whereas nodes af9aaf87cb934e499ebe2529f271496d, 2329043f0d264819923ed990f30fd49d, and be2fd1459597455582959a2f2e779858 employ GRU encoders.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are important as they explore different model architectures to process and classify symbolic glyph sequences. The insights gained help establish a baseline performance and guide future research towards improving specific metrics such as Color-Weighted Accuracy.",
  "Description": "Different approaches are used to handle symbolic glyph sequences. The experiments convert glyphs into 2D vectors and cluster these using k-means. Node c600de5f242c47ecac70675062d32eda uses an MLP classifier with a histogram representation, while the other nodes use GRU encoders to process sequences. Each model is evaluated using metrics like CWA, SWA, and DWHS.",
