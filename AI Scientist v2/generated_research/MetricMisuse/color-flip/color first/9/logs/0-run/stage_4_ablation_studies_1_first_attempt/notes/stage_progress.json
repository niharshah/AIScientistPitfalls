  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Robust Path Handling:** Implementing a robust path resolver to automatically discover dataset paths significantly reduced errors related to `FileNotFoundError`, ensuring that experiments could run consistently without manual intervention.\n\n- **Ablation Studies:** Conducting ablation studies, such as removing glyph clustering or positional encoding, provided insights into the contribution of each component. These studies helped identify which elements were crucial for maintaining high accuracy and which could be simplified or removed without significant loss in performance.\n\n- **Consistent Pipeline:** Maintaining a consistent pipeline across experiments, with only specific components altered for ablation studies, allowed for direct comparisons and clearer insights into the impact of each change.\n\n- **Error Handling Improvements:** Addressing errors by explicitly unpacking values and handling them individually (e.g., Balanced-Weighted Accuracy calculation) improved the robustness of the code and allowed for the addition of new metrics without introducing bugs.\n\n- **Data Structure Management:** Proper initialization and management of data structures, such as dictionaries for storing experiment results, ensured that data was correctly logged and accessible for analysis.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Improper Data Handling:** Errors such as TypeErrors and KeyErrors often stemmed from improper handling of data structures, such as attempting to format lists as floats or accessing uninitialized dictionary keys.\n\n- **Lack of Initialization:** Failing to initialize data structures for all expected keys led to KeyErrors. Ensuring that all necessary keys are initialized before use is crucial.\n\n- **Inadequate Debugging Depth:** Some errors were not deeply investigated, leading to repeated issues. Increasing the depth of debugging and thoroughly understanding the root cause of errors can prevent future occurrences.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Path Discovery:** Continue to refine the path discovery utility to accommodate any new dataset structures or environments, ensuring that experiments remain portable and easy to set up.\n\n- **Expand Ablation Studies:** Conduct further ablation studies to explore other components of the model, such as different pooling mechanisms or attention head configurations, to identify potential areas for simplification or improvement.\n\n- **Improve Error Handling:** Implement more comprehensive error handling and logging to capture detailed information about failures, which will aid in quicker diagnosis and resolution of issues.\n\n- **Ensure Data Structure Integrity:** Before accessing or modifying data structures, implement checks to ensure they are properly initialized. This can be done by using helper functions to manage data structure initialization and access.\n\n- **Optimize for Generalization:** Focus on strategies to improve generalization, such as regularization techniques or data augmentation, especially for experiments that show a significant gap between validation and test performance.\n\n- **Iterative Debugging:** Adopt an iterative approach to debugging, where each layer of the code is tested and validated before moving on to the next, ensuring that errors are caught early and do not propagate through the system.\n\nBy addressing these areas, future experiments can be conducted more efficiently, with a higher likelihood of success and meaningful insights."
