    "Summary": "This paper investigates challenges in color-shape classification tasks, reporting negative and inconclusive results to highlight pitfalls in existing architectures. The authors evaluate a baseline CNN and a transformer-based model on synthetic datasets, focusing on the generalization issues in color classification while shape classification is consistent.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper touches on a relevant topic in machine learning by identifying real-world pitfalls in color-shape classification tasks.",
        "The discussion about failure modes of common architectures could be useful for practitioners working on similar problems."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper lacks novelty and does not propose a new method or framework to address the challenges identified.",
        "The experimental setup is poorly described, with insufficient details about the dataset, training procedure, and hyperparameters.",
        "The results are not sufficiently rigorous, with no statistical analysis or comparison to alternative approaches beyond the baseline CNN and transformer model.",
        "Figures and analysis are limited, with critical experimental details relegated to an appendix without sufficient explanation in the main text.",
        "The paper fails to provide actionable insights or concrete recommendations for addressing the identified pitfalls, making the contribution less impactful."

    "Questions": [
        "What is the size and structure of the synthetic dataset used for experiments? Are these results generalizable to real-world datasets?",
        "Why were only a CNN and a transformer model considered? Were any other architectures (e.g., ResNet, Vision Transformers with pretraining) explored?",
        "How were hyperparameters like learning rates and optimizer settings chosen for the models? Were the experiments repeated to ensure robustness?",
        "Can the authors provide concrete examples of the 'problematic cases' in color classification, and why they are significant for real-world applications?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not propose any solutions to the identified pitfalls, limiting its practical utility.",
        "The clarity and organization of the paper are poor, with important details missing or relegated to the appendix.",
        "The experiments lack rigor and reproducibility due to the limited description of the methods and dataset."
