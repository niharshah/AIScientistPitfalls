## Title

Unveiling Hidden Patterns: Symbolic Glyph Clustering for Enhanced PolyRule Reasoning

## Short Hypothesis

Can symbolic glyph clustering based on latent feature representations enhance the accuracy and generalization of models in Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR)?

## Related Work

1. Deep Symbolic Learning: Previous works such as 'Deep Symbolic Learning for Neural Theorem Proving' have explored symbolic learning, but they do not focus on clustering symbolic glyphs for rule extraction in SPR. 2. Pattern Recognition: Studies like 'Pattern Recognition Using Machine Learning' generally deal with visual patterns and not abstract symbolic sequences. 3. Few-shot Learning: Research on few-shot learning like 'Prototypical Networks for Few-shot Learning' has shown the power of clustering in small data regimes but has not been adapted for symbolic reasoning tasks. Our approach differs as it applies clustering to enhance reasoning accuracy in a novel, abstract symbolic domain.

## Abstract

Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR) presents a unique challenge in machine learning, requiring models to decipher complex hidden rules governing sequences of abstract symbols. This proposal aims to enhance the performance and generalization of models in SPR by leveraging symbolic glyph clustering based on latent feature representations. We hypothesize that clustering symbolic glyphs before rule extraction can reveal hidden patterns and improve model accuracy. We will develop a novel algorithm that clusters symbolic glyphs into latent feature groups, which are then used to train a reasoning model. Using the SPR_BENCH dataset from HuggingFace, we will evaluate our approach on two metrics: Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) and Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA). Our objective is to surpass the current State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance of 70.0% for CWA and 65.0% for SWA.

## Experiments

- {'name': 'Clustering', 'description': 'Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN) to group glyphs based on latent features. Validate clustering quality using silhouette scores. Investigate the impact of different clustering algorithms and distance measures on clustering quality.'}
- {'name': 'Model Training', 'description': 'Develop a reasoning model that incorporates clustered glyphs. Train on the SPR_BENCH training split and tune on the dev split. Experiment with different model architectures (e.g., LSTMs, transformers) to assess the impact of clustering on various models.'}
- {'name': 'Evaluation', 'description': 'Evaluate on the test split using CWA and SWA metrics. Compare performance against SOTA benchmarks. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of clustering on model performance.'}

## Risk Factors And Limitations

- Cluster Quality: Ineffective clustering may degrade model performance rather than enhance it. Mitigation: Experiment with various clustering algorithms and validate clustering quality using silhouette scores.
- Scalability: High computational costs associated with clustering large datasets. Mitigation: Use dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA) before clustering to reduce computational complexity.
- Overfitting: Risk of overfitting to the training data due to complex clustering. Mitigation: Use regularization techniques and cross-validation to prevent overfitting.
- Generalization: The proposed method may not generalize well to entirely unseen categories of symbolic sequences. Mitigation: Ensure a diverse training set and conduct extensive testing on unseen data to assess generalization.
