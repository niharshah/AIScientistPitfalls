    "Summary": "The paper discusses inconclusive findings and partial failures in attempts to improve zero-shot classification of visual objects. It highlights trade-offs between shape and color-based tasks, noting that improvements in one area often degrade performance in the other. Architectural modifications like freezing embeddings or removing attention modules yielded ambiguous results. The authors argue for more open reporting of such negative results to advance the field.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses the underexplored area of publishing negative results and partial failures, which is important for transparent scientific progress.",
        "Highlights the trade-off between shape-based and color-based tasks, which could be relevant for specific applications."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper lacks clear contributions or actionable insights. While it reports negative findings, it does not propose or analyze solutions to address the observed failures.",
        "The methodology is vague and poorly described, making it difficult to assess the validity of the experiments or reproduce the results.",
        "The experimental results are minimal and provide limited evidence or depth. For instance, only a few benchmarks and metrics are mentioned, and the results are not thoroughly analyzed.",
        "The related work section is sparse and lacks citations to key papers in zero-shot classification, attention mechanisms, or robustness in deep learning.",
        "The presentation is unclear, with incomplete descriptions of the methods, missing references (e.g., marked as '[?]'), and insufficient visualizations or explanations in the results.",
        "The conclusion is weak, offering no definitive takeaways or directions for future work beyond generic suggestions."

    "Questions": [
        "Can the authors provide more details about the experimental setup, including datasets, architectures, and metrics used?",

        "How does this work build on or differ from existing research on robustness and zero-shot classification?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not adequately address its limitations. For instance, it does not discuss the narrow scope of the experiments or the lack of generalizability of its findings.",
        "Potential societal impacts or ethical considerations are not addressed, though they may not be central to this work."
