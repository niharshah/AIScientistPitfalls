        "Img_review": "The figure is missing, and no meaningful content is present for evaluation. The authors should ensure that the actual figure is included in the final submission for proper assessment.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption, 'Comparison of baseline performance across shape and color tasks,' is concise but lacks detail. Without the figure, it is unclear whether the caption accurately describes the content. The caption could benefit from including a key takeaway or specific data points for clarity.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The references in the main text attempt to integrate the figure by discussing trends in shape and color task performance, as well as the effects of architectural modifications. However, without the actual figure, it is impossible to assess whether these references effectively describe the figure's content or context. The authors should ensure the figure is included to validate these references."
