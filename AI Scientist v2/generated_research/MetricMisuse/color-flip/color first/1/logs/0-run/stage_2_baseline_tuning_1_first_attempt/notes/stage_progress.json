  "current_findings": "### Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Baseline Design and Implementation**: The minimal-viable baseline was effectively built using a simple bag-of-chars representation and a two-layer feed-forward network. This approach provided a clean and reproducible starting point for further experimentation.\n\n- **Consistent Metric Tracking**: Successful experiments consistently tracked and evaluated key metrics such as Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), and their harmonic mean (HMWA). This allowed for clear comparisons across different configurations.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic hyperparameter tuning, such as adjusting batch sizes and hidden dimensions, was effectively implemented. This approach allowed for the identification of optimal configurations and ensured that the experiments were data-driven.\n\n- **Structured Data Storage**: All metrics, losses, predictions, and ground-truths were stored in a structured experiment_data dictionary. This facilitated easy retrieval and analysis of results, contributing to the reproducibility and transparency of the experiments.\n\n- **Error-Free Execution**: The experiments were executed without errors, indicating robust implementation and adherence to GPU handling rules, which ensured smooth execution across different environments.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Lack of Logging and Progress Indication**: In failed experiments, there was a notable absence of meaningful logs and progress indicators. This made it difficult to determine whether the script executed successfully or encountered issues.\n\n- **Incomplete Execution Output**: Some experiments did not provide complete execution outputs, which hindered the ability to assess the training progress and final results. This could be due to issues with logging or execution flow.\n\n- **Potential Early Termination**: There may have been early termination or redirection of output in some experiments, preventing the display of expected results and logs.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Logging and Monitoring**: Ensure that all scripts include comprehensive logging that captures epoch progress, validation metrics, and final test results. This will aid in diagnosing issues and understanding the training process.\n\n- **Verify Execution Flow**: Double-check the execution flow to ensure that all print statements are functioning correctly and that outputs are not being redirected or terminated prematurely.\n\n- **Implement Early-Stopping Mechanisms**: While early-stopping was attempted in some experiments, ensure that it is correctly implemented and that its effects are clearly logged to provide insights into model convergence.\n\n- **Expand Hyperparameter Exploration**: Continue exploring a wider range of hyperparameters, including learning rates and epoch numbers, to further optimize model performance.\n\n- **Ensure Dataset Integrity**: Verify that datasets are properly loaded and that synthetic fallbacks are functioning as intended to prevent any disruptions in the training process.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations and building on the successful patterns observed, future experiments can achieve more robust and insightful results."
