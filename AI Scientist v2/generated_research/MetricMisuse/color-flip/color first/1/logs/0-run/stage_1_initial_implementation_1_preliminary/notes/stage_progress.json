  "current_findings": "## Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Baseline Design**: Successful experiments utilized a minimal-viable baseline approach, converting symbolic sequences into fixed-size numeric vectors. This was achieved by counting ASCII characters, normalizing by sequence length, and using a 128-dimensional bag-of-chars representation. This simple yet effective method allowed for capturing both shapes and colors.\n\n- **Model Architecture**: A two-layer feed-forward network trained with cross-entropy was consistently used. This straightforward architecture provided a reliable starting point for further experimentation.\n\n- **Data Handling**: Successful experiments ensured that datasets were either loaded from official splits or generated synthetically, ensuring the script was always runnable. This approach avoided interruptions due to missing data.\n\n- **Evaluation and Metrics**: Regular evaluation on a development split was crucial. Metrics like Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), and their Harmonic Mean (HMWA) were computed after every epoch, allowing for continuous monitoring of model performance.\n\n- **Reproducibility**: All metrics, losses, predictions, and ground-truths were stored in a structured dictionary and saved for later analysis. This ensured that experiments were fully reproducible and results could be easily analyzed.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **File Handling Errors**: A recurring issue was the failure to locate dataset files, leading to FileNotFoundError. This was often due to incorrect dataset paths or missing files.\n\n- **Synthetic Data Generation**: When fallback to synthetic data was required, incorrect data structure handling led to errors, such as AttributeError. This was due to improper function usage during synthetic data creation.\n\n- **Dataset Path Management**: Incorrect dataset paths were a common source of errors. Ensuring the correct placement and path specification of dataset files is crucial to avoid execution failures.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Robust Data Handling**: Ensure that dataset files are correctly placed in the specified directories. Implement robust error handling to check the integrity of dataset paths and contents before proceeding with the loading process.\n\n- **Synthetic Data Improvements**: Revise the synthetic data generation process to ensure correct data structure handling. Consider saving synthetic data as a JSON file and loading it properly to avoid AttributeErrors.\n\n- **Model and Training Enhancements**: While the baseline model provides a good starting point, future experiments should explore deeper networks, better clustering techniques, and self-supervised glyph embeddings to improve performance and potentially surpass State-of-the-Art benchmarks.\n\n- **Path and Environment Configuration**: Regularly verify and update dataset paths and environment configurations to prevent FileNotFoundErrors. Consider using environment variables or configuration files to manage paths dynamically.\n\n- **Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation**: Maintain the practice of regular evaluation and metric computation to monitor model performance. This allows for timely identification of issues and informed decision-making for model improvements.\n\nBy addressing these key areas, future experiments can build on the successes and learn from past failures to achieve more robust and high-performing models."
