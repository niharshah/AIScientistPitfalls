  "Experiment_description": "The experiments aimed to establish a baseline for glyph-clustering using a bag-of-characters model implemented in PyTorch, evaluated with metrics such as Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), and their harmonic mean (HMWA).",
  "Significance": "These experiments are important as they provide a stable and reproducible baseline for glyph-clustering methodologies, essential for future research and enhancements. The consistent performance across nodes builds confidence in the reliability of this baseline.",
  "Description": "The experiments utilized a two-layer feed-forward network trained on a bag-of-characters representation of symbolic sequences. The models were evaluated using CWA, SWA, and HMWA metrics to determine their effectiveness at capturing shape and color patterns. The consistent results across different nodes demonstrate the model's stability and readiness for future refinement.",
