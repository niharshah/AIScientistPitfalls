  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Disentangled Representation**: The successful experiments often utilized a disentangled representation that separates shape and color embeddings. This approach allows the model to directly access the latent factors of interest, improving generalization without relying on brittle pre-clustering heuristics.\n\n- **Transformer Encoder**: The use of a light Transformer encoder to learn the compositional interaction between shape and color embeddings has been effective. The baseline model with positional embeddings achieved high validation accuracies, indicating the importance of capturing positional information.\n\n- **Ablation Studies**: Various ablation studies, such as removing position embeddings or using a single-head self-attention, provided insights into the importance of different components. While some ablations resulted in reduced performance, they still maintained reasonable accuracy, demonstrating the robustness of the overall architecture.\n\n- **High Validation Performance**: Across successful experiments, models consistently achieved high Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), and Composite Variety Accuracy (CVA) on the validation set, often nearing 99%.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Overfitting**: A recurring issue in both successful and failed experiments is overfitting, where models perform well on training and validation sets but poorly on test data. This is evident in experiments with frozen embeddings and concat-fusion embeddings, where test accuracies dropped significantly.\n\n- **Lack of Generalization**: Some experiments, such as the concat-fusion embeddings, failed to generalize to unseen data despite high validation performance. This suggests that the model's capacity to generalize was compromised, possibly due to insufficient regularization or data diversity.\n\n- **Ablation Limitations**: While ablation studies are useful for understanding component importance, they sometimes lead to reduced performance, highlighting the delicate balance required in model design.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Regularization Techniques**: To address overfitting, incorporate regularization methods such as dropout, weight decay, and early stopping. These techniques can help improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.\n\n- **Data Augmentation and Diversity**: Increase the diversity of the training dataset or apply data augmentation techniques to enhance the model's generalization capabilities. This can mitigate overfitting and improve test performance.\n\n- **Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation to better assess the model's performance across different data splits. This can provide a more robust evaluation of the model's generalization ability.\n\n- **Explore Alternative Fusion Strategies**: Given the failure of the concat-fusion embeddings, explore other fusion strategies that might better capture the interaction between shape, color, and positional information without compromising generalization.\n\n- **Further Ablation Studies**: Continue conducting ablation studies to isolate and understand the contributions of individual components. However, ensure that these studies are complemented with strategies to mitigate any identified weaknesses, such as overfitting.\n\nBy focusing on these recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes while addressing the challenges observed in the current set of experiments."
