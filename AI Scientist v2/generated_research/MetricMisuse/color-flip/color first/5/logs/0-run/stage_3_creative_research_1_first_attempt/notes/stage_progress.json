  "current_findings": "### Comprehensive Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **N-gram Feature Engineering**: Successful experiments often utilized n-gram feature extraction, either through CountVectorizer or by converting sequences into cluster strings. This approach consistently yielded high validation and test accuracies.\n\n- **Clustering Techniques**: Clustering glyph tokens using K-Means with simple embeddings (e.g., one-hot or two-hot vectors) was a common and effective strategy. The use of silhouette scores to evaluate cluster quality and incorporate them into metrics like Cluster-Consistency-Weighted Accuracy (CCWA) was a recurring theme.\n\n- **Lightweight Models and Pipelines**: The use of small MLPs and lightweight clustering methods allowed for quick experimentation and iteration, maintaining high validation accuracies while being computationally efficient.\n\n- **Metric Innovations**: The introduction of new metrics like CCWA, which combines model correctness with cluster quality, provided additional insights into model performance beyond traditional accuracy metrics.\n\n- **Rescaling Techniques**: Rescaling silhouette coefficients to a positive range improved the reliability of the CCWA metric, ensuring it provided meaningful feedback on model performance.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **CCWA Calculation Errors**: A consistent issue was the incorrect calculation of the CCWA metric, often resulting in zero values. This was typically due to negative silhouette scores or incorrect handling of cluster correctness.\n\n- **Over-reliance on Simple Embeddings**: While simple embeddings were effective, they sometimes limited the model's ability to capture more complex patterns, as evidenced by test accuracies not surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks.\n\n- **Insufficient Debugging**: Failed experiments often lacked thorough debugging, particularly in the implementation of new metrics like CCWA. This led to persistent errors that could have been resolved with deeper investigation.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Feature Engineering**: Consider integrating more sophisticated feature extraction methods, such as using pre-trained embeddings like BERT, to capture complex patterns and potentially improve test performance.\n\n- **Refine Clustering Approaches**: Experiment with different clustering algorithms or hyperparameters to improve cluster quality, which could enhance the effectiveness of metrics like CCWA.\n\n- **Robust Metric Implementation**: Ensure that new metrics are thoroughly tested and debugged. For CCWA, verify that silhouette scores are correctly rescaled and that the metric accurately reflects model performance.\n\n- **Iterative Testing and Debugging**: Implement a systematic approach to debugging, especially for new metrics and model components. This includes unit testing individual functions and validating intermediate outputs.\n\n- **Balance Simplicity and Complexity**: While lightweight models are beneficial for rapid iteration, explore the integration of more complex models where appropriate to push the boundaries of current performance benchmarks.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, future experiments can build on the successes while avoiding common pitfalls, leading to more robust and insightful outcomes."
