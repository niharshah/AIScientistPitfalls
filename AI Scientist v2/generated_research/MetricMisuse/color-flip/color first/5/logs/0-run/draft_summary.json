  "Experiment_description": "The experiments conducted in this stage implement a Bag-of-Tokens model with a feed-forward network to process and classify glyphs. Both nodes focus on establishing a robust baseline using cross-entropy loss for training on both real and synthetic datasets.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are significant as they establish a foundational pipeline for glyph processing, crucial for future enhancements in glyph clustering techniques. The consistency and robustness of the baseline model are necessary for ensuring reliable performance benchmarks against which future innovations can be compared.",
  "Description": "The experiments involved treating each glyph as a token and vectorizing sequences using a Bag-of-Tokens model, followed by training a small two-layer feed-forward network optimized for GPU usage. Both nodes aim to develop a foundational baseline, focusing on reproducibility and robustness, with metrics such as accuracy, Color-Weighted Accuracy, Shape-Weighted Accuracy, and Complexity-Weighted Accuracy reported for both validation and test datasets.",
