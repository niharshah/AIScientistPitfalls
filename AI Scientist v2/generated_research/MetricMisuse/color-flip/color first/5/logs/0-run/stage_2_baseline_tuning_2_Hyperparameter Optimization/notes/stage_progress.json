  "current_findings": "### Comprehensive Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Early Stopping Mechanism**: Implementing an early stopping mechanism with a patience of 5 epochs was effective in preventing overfitting and optimizing training time. This approach allowed the model to halt training once the validation loss stopped improving, ensuring efficient resource use.\n\n- **Structured Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic grid-search for hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, weight decay, hidden layer size, and activation functions led to successful model training. Each parameter was explored in isolation, allowing for clear identification of optimal settings.\n\n- **Consistent Logging and Data Storage**: All experiments consistently logged training and validation metrics, which were then stored in a structured format (e.g., `experiment_data.npy`). This facilitated easy analysis and comparison of results across different experiments.\n\n- **Model Evaluation on Test Set**: After identifying the best-performing model on the validation set, it was evaluated on the test set, ensuring that the results were generalizable beyond the training and validation data.\n\n- **High Validation Accuracy**: Many experiments achieved high validation accuracies, indicating that the models were effectively learning from the data. For instance, the n-gram range tuning achieved a validation accuracy of 99.14%.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Suboptimal Test Performance**: Despite high validation accuracies, some experiments did not achieve the desired state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the test set. This suggests potential overfitting or that the model architecture and hyperparameters were not fully optimized for the test data.\n\n- **Limited Exploration of Hyperparameter Space**: While grid-search was used, the range of hyperparameters explored was sometimes limited. For example, only a few learning rates or batch sizes were tested, which might have restricted the identification of truly optimal settings.\n\n- **Lack of Model Complexity**: Some experiments, such as those involving hidden layer size, did not surpass SOTA benchmarks, indicating that the model complexity might not have been sufficient for the task.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Expand Hyperparameter Search Space**: Consider using more sophisticated hyperparameter optimization techniques, such as Bayesian optimization or random search, to explore a broader range of values and potentially discover better-performing configurations.\n\n- **Enhance Model Complexity**: Experiment with deeper architectures or additional layers to increase model capacity, especially for tasks where current models are not meeting SOTA benchmarks.\n\n- **Regularization Techniques**: Implement additional regularization methods, such as dropout or data augmentation, to reduce overfitting and improve generalization to the test set.\n\n- **Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation to ensure that the model's performance is robust across different subsets of the data, providing a more reliable estimate of its generalization capabilities.\n\n- **Iterative Experimentation**: Adopt an iterative approach to experimentation, where insights from each round of experiments inform subsequent trials, allowing for continuous refinement of the model and its hyperparameters.\n\nBy building on these insights and recommendations, future experiments can be more targeted and effective, ultimately leading to improved model performance and achieving desired benchmarks."
