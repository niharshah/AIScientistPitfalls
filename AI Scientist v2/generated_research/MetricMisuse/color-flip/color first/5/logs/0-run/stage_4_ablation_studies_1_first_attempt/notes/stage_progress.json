  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Cluster-Based Features**: The integration of cluster-based features, derived from K-means clustering of BERT embeddings, consistently improved model performance. This approach, as seen in the baseline experiment, led to high validation and test accuracies, particularly in cluster-consistency-weighted accuracy (CCWA).\n\n- **BERT Embeddings**: Utilizing BERT embeddings for token representation was a successful strategy. Even when ablations altered other parts of the pipeline, maintaining BERT embeddings generally resulted in better performance compared to alternatives like ordinal vectors.\n\n- **Feature Concatenation**: Combining cluster-based features with original token n-grams proved effective. The experiments that retained both feature types (e.g., baseline) outperformed those that removed one type (e.g., Remove-Token-Feature Ablation).\n\n- **Self-Contained and Efficient Scripts**: The experiments were designed to be self-contained, GPU-aware, and efficient, completing in a few minutes. This facilitated rapid iteration and testing of different experimental setups.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Removal of Key Features**: Ablations that removed significant features, such as the Remove-Token-Feature Ablation, resulted in noticeable performance drops. This highlights the importance of maintaining a diverse set of features for robust model performance.\n\n- **Random Cluster Assignments**: The Random-Cluster-Assignment Ablation showed that destroying the semantic meaning of clusters negatively impacted performance, particularly in CCWA. This suggests that meaningful clustering is crucial for leveraging cluster-based features effectively.\n\n- **Simplified Embeddings**: The ORD-Embedding-Cluster Ablation, which used 2-D ordinal vectors instead of BERT embeddings, showed a performance drop, indicating that simpler embeddings may not capture the necessary semantic richness.\n\n- **Loss of Sequential Information**: The Token-Order-Shuffle Ablation demonstrated that losing the true sequential order of tokens can degrade performance, emphasizing the importance of maintaining sequence integrity.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Clustering Techniques**: Future experiments could explore more advanced clustering techniques or hybrid approaches to improve the semantic coherence of clusters, potentially boosting the effectiveness of cluster-based features.\n\n- **Maintain Feature Diversity**: Ensure that future models retain a diverse set of features, including both token and cluster-based features, to capture different aspects of the data.\n\n- **Leverage Pre-trained Models**: Continue utilizing pre-trained models like BERT for embeddings, as they provide a strong foundation for capturing semantic information.\n\n- **Experiment with Feature Engineering**: Investigate additional feature engineering techniques, such as incorporating bigrams or trigrams, to capture more complex patterns in the data.\n\n- **Preserve Sequential Order**: Ensure that the sequential order of tokens is preserved in the pipeline to maintain the contextual integrity of the data.\n\n- **Iterate on Successful Designs**: Build upon the successful elements of the baseline and ORD-Embedding-Cluster Ablation designs, potentially exploring different dimensionalities or embedding strategies to further optimize performance.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, future experiments can build on the successes observed while avoiding common pitfalls, leading to more robust and effective models."
