  "current_findings": "## Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Baseline Model Effectiveness**: The initial baseline model, which uses a Bag-of-Tokens approach with a simple two-layer feed-forward network, proved effective. It achieved high validation accuracy and complexity-weighted accuracy, indicating that even without explicit glyph clustering, the model can perform well.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic tuning of hyperparameters such as `epochs`, `learning_rate`, `batch_size`, and `weight_decay` demonstrated clear improvements in model performance. For instance, tuning the number of epochs showed that longer training (up to a point) improved validation accuracy and reduced losses.\n\n- **Structured Data Handling**: The use of a structured `experiment_data` dictionary to store metrics, losses, and predictions facilitated easy tracking of results and comparisons across different settings. This approach ensures reproducibility and ease of analysis.\n\n- **Device Handling**: Efficient device handling by moving the model, data, and batches to GPU when available contributed to the successful execution of experiments, ensuring that computational resources were optimally utilized.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Overfitting with Increased Epochs**: While increasing the number of epochs generally improved validation accuracy, there was a point of diminishing returns where further increases led to overfitting, as seen in the slight decrease in test accuracy for 30 epochs.\n\n- **Learning Rate Sensitivity**: The choice of learning rate was critical. While a small logarithmic grid was used, choosing an inappropriate learning rate could lead to suboptimal convergence or divergence during training.\n\n- **Batch Size Trade-offs**: Larger batch sizes resulted in higher test accuracies but at the cost of increased validation losses. This trade-off suggests that while larger batches can stabilize training, they may not always generalize well.\n\n- **Weight Decay Misconfiguration**: Incorrect settings of the weight decay parameter could either under-regularize or over-regularize the model, impacting its ability to generalize from training to test data.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Explore Advanced Clustering Techniques**: Given the success of the baseline without explicit glyph clustering, future experiments could layer more sophisticated glyph-clustering techniques to potentially enhance performance further.\n\n- **Fine-tune Hyperparameters**: Continue to refine hyperparameter tuning, particularly focusing on a more granular search for learning rates and weight decay values to find the optimal balance for regularization and convergence.\n\n- **Monitor Overfitting**: Implement early stopping or regularization techniques to mitigate overfitting, especially when experimenting with longer training durations.\n\n- **Experiment with Model Architectures**: Explore different model architectures, such as deeper networks or convolutional layers, to capture more complex patterns in the data.\n\n- **Utilize Cross-Validation**: Incorporate cross-validation to ensure that the model's performance is robust across different subsets of the data, reducing the risk of overfitting to a particular train-test split.\n\nBy leveraging these insights and recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes observed while avoiding common pitfalls, ultimately leading to more robust and effective models."
