  "current_findings": "### Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n- **Baseline Model Simplicity**: Successful experiments often started with a simple yet effective baseline. The use of a Bag-of-Tokens model with a small two-layer feed-forward network proved to be a solid starting point. This approach allowed for straightforward implementation and evaluation, providing a functional end-to-end pipeline.\n- **Device Handling**: Proper management of device handling, such as moving data and models to GPU when available, was a key factor in the success of experiments. This ensured efficient training and evaluation processes.\n- **Structured Data Persistence**: Storing all metrics, losses, predictions, and ground-truth labels in a structured experiment_data dictionary and saving it as a .npy file facilitated reproducibility and further analysis.\n- **Validation and Testing**: Regular reporting of validation loss and accuracy metrics (including Color-Weighted Accuracy, Shape-Weighted Accuracy, and Complexity-Weighted Accuracy) helped in monitoring the model's performance and identifying areas for improvement.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n- **Dataset Path Issues**: A recurring issue was the incorrect or missing dataset path, leading to FileNotFoundError. Ensuring the dataset files are present in the specified directory and that the DATA_PATH variable is correctly set is crucial.\n- **Indexing Errors**: TypeErrors due to improper indexing in data handling, such as attempting to index a list with another list, were common. Proper handling of batch indices in DataLoader configurations is necessary to avoid such errors.\n- **Overfitting**: Some experiments showed high validation accuracy but poor test set performance, indicating overfitting. This suggests the need for regularization techniques and careful monitoring of model performance on unseen data.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n- **Start Simple, Then Iterate**: Begin with a simple baseline model to establish a functional pipeline. Once a robust baseline is achieved, gradually introduce more sophisticated techniques such as glyph clustering or advanced embeddings.\n- **Ensure Dataset Availability**: Double-check dataset paths and ensure all required files are in the correct directories before running experiments. Consider implementing checks in the code to verify dataset presence and path correctness.\n- **Handle Indices Properly**: Pay attention to how indices are handled in data processing. Ensure that DataLoader configurations are set up to pass indices correctly, and modify data handling methods to accommodate batch processing.\n- **Address Overfitting**: Implement regularization techniques such as dropout or weight decay to mitigate overfitting. Consider using early stopping based on validation performance and expanding the training dataset to improve generalization.\n- **Leverage GPU Resources**: Continue to utilize GPU resources for training and evaluation to enhance computational efficiency and reduce execution time.\n\nBy following these recommendations and learning from both successful and failed experiments, future iterations can achieve improved performance and robustness."
