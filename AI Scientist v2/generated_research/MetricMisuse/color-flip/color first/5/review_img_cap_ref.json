        "Img_description": "The figure contains two subplots labeled (a) Training loss curves and (b) Test metrics (ACC, etc.). Both subplots display placeholder text ('Baseline_Loss_Curves.png' and 'Baseline_Test_Metrics.png'), indicating the absence of actual plots.",
        "Img_review": "The figure lacks actual data visualization, making it impossible to analyze trends or verify claims. Placeholder text should be replaced with proper plots displaying training loss curves and test metrics. Include clear axis labels, legends, and detailed visual information.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption describes the intended content of the figure but cannot be verified due to the absence of actual data. Once the plots are added, the caption should be revised to include specific observations, such as where training losses plateau or test metrics show variance.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references provide general context for the figure's intended purpose, mentioning diverging training curves and varying test metrics. However, the absence of visual data limits their ability to adequately explain or integrate the figure's content. The references should be expanded to highlight specific patterns or trends visible in the actual plots once they are included."
