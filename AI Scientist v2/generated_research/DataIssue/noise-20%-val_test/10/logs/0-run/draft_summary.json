  "Experiment_description": "Experiments were conducted using SPR_BENCH dataset to establish a baseline for character sequence classification. Methods included a simple average-embedding classifier and a more complex bi-directional LSTM with mean-pooled hidden states.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are crucial for establishing an interpretable baseline model that can be iteratively improved upon. The insights into model performance and areas of overfitting provide a foundation for developing more robust models, potentially improving generalization and interpretability.",
  "Description": "The experiments involved creating character-level vocabularies and encoding sequences as integer lists. A simple model used average embeddings for classification, while more advanced models utilized bi-directional LSTMs with mean-pooled hidden states. Metrics like Macro-F1 and loss were tracked to evaluate performance.",
