        "Img_review": "The provided image lacks any meaningful content or visualization to support analysis. It appears to be a placeholder and does not convey any information about classification performance or rule adherence. To improve, the figure should include relevant data visualizations, such as plots or metrics, with clear labeling and legends.",

        "Img_review": "The placeholder image does not provide any scientific or analytical content. It should be replaced with a meaningful figure that demonstrates the claimed example misclassification scenario. Adding labels, legends, and visual elements to illustrate logical rules and features would improve interpretability.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption claims to depict an example misclassification scenario where logical rules are violated. However, the placeholder image does not align with this description, as it contains no content to support the claim. The caption should be revised to match a relevant and informative figure.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references are entirely missing (`[]`), leaving no explanation or integration of the figure into the paper's context. The references should describe the figure's purpose, content, and relevance to the paper's arguments."
