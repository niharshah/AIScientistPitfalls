  "Experiment_description": "The experiments involved creating interpretable models using various character-based representations on the SPR_BENCH dataset. Methods included logistic regression, single-layer perceptron, and two-layer MLP models, each evaluated for accuracy, rule fidelity, and FAGM.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are crucial for understanding the trade-offs between model interpretability and performance. They highlight the challenges and successes in creating models that are both accurate and provide meaningful explanations, which is vital for applications requiring transparency.",
  "Description": "Each sequence was vectorized using different approaches, from bag-of-characters to character 3-gram counts. Logistic regression, a single-layer softmax perceptron, and two-layer MLP architectures were employed. Rule fidelity and FAGM were calculated to assess interpretability alongside accuracy.",
