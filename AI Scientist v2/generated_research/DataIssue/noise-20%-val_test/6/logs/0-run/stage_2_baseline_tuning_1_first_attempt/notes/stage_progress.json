  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Interpretability and Simplicity**: The use of a simple, interpretable model (multinomial logistic regression) that treats sequences as bags of n-grams proved effective. This design allows for easy derivation of symbolic rules and provides a quantitative interpretability score (Rule Fidelity).\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic tuning of hyperparameters such as epochs, learning rate, weight decay, and batch size significantly improved model performance. For instance, extending the training span with early stopping and identifying the optimal learning rate (0.005) led to notable gains in validation and test accuracy.\n\n- **Efficient Logging and Saving**: Consistent logging of metrics, losses, and predictions, and saving them for future analysis, facilitated a structured approach to experimentation. This practice ensured that all results were available for later inspection and comparison.\n\n- **Device Compliance**: Strict adherence to GPU/CPU device rules ensured smooth execution and avoided common pitfalls related to device compatibility.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Overfitting**: While not explicitly mentioned in the failed experiments, overfitting is a common issue in machine learning experiments, especially when models perform significantly better on training data compared to validation or test data. This can be inferred from the need for early stopping and careful hyperparameter tuning.\n\n- **Inadequate Exploration of Hyperparameters**: Although not directly observed in the failed experiments, insufficient exploration of hyperparameter spaces can lead to suboptimal model performance. The successful experiments highlight the importance of thorough hyperparameter tuning.\n\n- **Lack of Interpretability**: Models that are not easily interpretable can hinder the understanding of decision-making processes, which is crucial for debugging and improving models.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Maintain Simplicity and Interpretability**: Continue to prioritize models that offer interpretability alongside performance. This approach not only aids in understanding model behavior but also facilitates debugging and improvement.\n\n- **Expand Hyperparameter Search**: Consider expanding the hyperparameter search space and employing automated hyperparameter optimization techniques to ensure optimal model configurations are identified.\n\n- **Implement Regularization Techniques**: To mitigate overfitting, incorporate regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization, especially when increasing model complexity.\n\n- **Enhance Logging and Monitoring**: Continue to enhance logging and monitoring practices by integrating more sophisticated tools for real-time tracking of experiments, which can provide immediate insights and facilitate quicker iterations.\n\n- **Focus on Rule Fidelity**: Given the importance of interpretability, place a stronger emphasis on improving rule fidelity alongside accuracy metrics. This can lead to models that not only perform well but are also trustworthy and easier to interpret.\n\nBy leveraging these insights and recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes observed while avoiding common pitfalls, leading to more robust and interpretable models."
