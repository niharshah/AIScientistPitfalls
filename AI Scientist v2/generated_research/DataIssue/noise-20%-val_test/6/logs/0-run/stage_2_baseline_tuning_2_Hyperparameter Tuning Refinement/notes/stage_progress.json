  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The experiments demonstrated the importance of hyperparameter tuning in improving model performance. Each experiment focused on a specific hyperparameter (e.g., number of epochs, learning rate, batch size, weight decay), and systematic grid-search approaches were employed to identify optimal values.\n\n- **Early Stopping and Regularization**: The use of early stopping (with a patience of 5 on validation loss) and weight decay (L2 regularization) helped prevent overfitting and improved generalization, as evidenced by the consistent validation and test accuracies across experiments.\n\n- **Incremental Learning Rate Improvements**: The learning rate tuning experiment showed that increasing the learning rate led to better model performance, with the highest test accuracy achieved at the largest learning rate tested (0.003).\n\n- **Batch Size Optimization**: The batch size tuning experiment indicated that adjusting batch sizes can significantly impact model performance, with larger batch sizes generally leading to better train and validation accuracies.\n\n- **Comprehensive Metric Tracking**: Tracking a wide range of metrics (train/validation accuracy, loss, rule fidelity, test accuracy) allowed for a thorough evaluation of model performance and facilitated the identification of optimal hyperparameter settings.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Lack of Exploration in Failed Experiments**: While the summary does not provide details on failed experiments, a common pitfall in experimental design is not exploring a wide enough range of hyperparameters or configurations, which can lead to suboptimal performance.\n\n- **Overfitting Risks**: Although not explicitly mentioned as a failure, overfitting is a common issue when models perform well on training data but poorly on validation/test data. This risk can be mitigated by using techniques like early stopping and regularization.\n\n- **Insufficient Validation**: Relying solely on training metrics without adequate validation can lead to misleading conclusions about model performance.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Expand Hyperparameter Ranges**: To ensure comprehensive exploration, consider expanding the range of hyperparameters tested, especially if initial results indicate potential for further improvement.\n\n- **Incorporate Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation to obtain a more robust estimate of model performance and reduce the risk of overfitting to a single validation set.\n\n- **Analyze Failed Experiments**: Document and analyze failed experiments to identify potential areas for improvement and avoid repeating the same mistakes.\n\n- **Experiment with Advanced Techniques**: Explore advanced techniques such as adaptive learning rates, dropout, or more sophisticated model architectures to further enhance performance.\n\n- **Ensure Reproducibility**: Maintain detailed records of experimental setups, including random seeds and data splits, to ensure results can be reproduced and verified.\n\n- **Focus on Interpretability**: Continue to track rule fidelity and other interpretability metrics to ensure that models are not only accurate but also understandable and trustworthy."
