  "current_findings": "## Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Optimizer Selection**: The experiment with different optimizers (Adam vs. SGD with varying momentum) showed that optimizer choice significantly impacts model performance. The best configuration was selected based on dev accuracy, highlighting the importance of hyperparameter tuning.\n\n- **Feature Engineering**: The Unigram-only and TF-IDF Weighted n-gram Feature Ablations demonstrated that altering feature representations can lead to improvements in training and validation metrics. The Unigram-only ablation, in particular, achieved high rule fidelity and test accuracy, indicating that simpler feature sets can sometimes be more effective.\n\n- **Normalization Techniques**: The Length-Normalised n-gram Feature Ablation showed that normalizing feature vectors can help maintain relative distributions while removing sequence-length biases. This approach resulted in balanced performance across train, validation, and test sets.\n\n- **Model Simplification**: The No-Bias Logistic Regression Ablation achieved high training accuracy by simplifying the model architecture (removing bias). This suggests that reducing model complexity can sometimes yield better results, especially in terms of training efficiency.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Overfitting**: While not explicitly mentioned as a failure, the high training accuracy compared to validation accuracy in some experiments (e.g., No-Bias Logistic Regression) suggests potential overfitting. This is a common pitfall when the model performs well on training data but not as well on unseen data.\n\n- **Complexity vs. Performance Trade-off**: Introducing complex feature engineering or model architectures without clear performance gains can lead to unnecessary computational overhead. For instance, while TF-IDF weighting improved training accuracy, it did not significantly enhance validation or test performance.\n\n- **Lack of Generalization**: Experiments that focus too heavily on optimizing for specific datasets or conditions may not generalize well to other scenarios. Ensuring that models are robust across different datasets is crucial for practical applications.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Continue Hyperparameter Exploration**: Given the success of optimizer tuning, further exploration of hyperparameters (e.g., learning rates, batch sizes) could yield additional performance improvements. Consider using automated hyperparameter optimization techniques.\n\n- **Balance Simplicity and Complexity**: While simpler models and feature sets have shown success, it's important to strike a balance between simplicity and the ability to capture necessary data patterns. Future experiments could explore hybrid approaches that combine simple and complex features.\n\n- **Focus on Generalization**: To avoid overfitting, incorporate techniques such as cross-validation, regularization, and dropout. Additionally, testing models on diverse datasets can help ensure robustness and generalization.\n\n- **Evaluate Computational Efficiency**: Consider the computational cost of different approaches, especially when scaling models for larger datasets. Efficient algorithms and feature representations should be prioritized to reduce training time and resource usage.\n\n- **Document and Analyze Failures**: Although specific failures were not detailed, systematically documenting and analyzing unsuccessful experiments can provide valuable insights and prevent repeating similar mistakes in the future."
