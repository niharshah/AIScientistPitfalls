% This paper provides a foundational discussion on neural-symbolic integration, detailing the computational implications and challenges of combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning. It is relevant to the methodology section of the proposal, supporting the theoretical basis for integrating rule-based reasoning with neural networks in the proposed research.

% The paper introduces LIME, a foundational and widely used method for interpretable machine learning. It provides explanations of model predictions in a model-agnostic manner and is highly relevant for contrasting the proposed method with existing approaches in interpretable AI. This should be cited in the related work section to highlight existing interpretability methods and explain what the proposal aims to address beyond these techniques.

% Paper 0 introduces FinChain, a symbolic reasoning benchmark for chain-of-thought financial reasoning, which parallels the Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning task with its focus on multi-step symbolic reasoning and reasoning complexity. This should be cited in the related work section to situate SPR_BENCH within the broader context of symbolic reasoning benchmarks and highlight its unique contributions. Paper 4 discusses the need for a common dataset in neural-symbolic reasoning studies, which supports the theoretical justification for developing SPR_BENCH and should be cited in the introduction or methodology section to emphasize the importance of standardized benchmarks.
