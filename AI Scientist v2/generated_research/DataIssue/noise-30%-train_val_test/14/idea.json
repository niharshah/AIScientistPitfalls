    "Title": "Enhancing Transformer Models with Symbolic Reasoning Capabilities for Symbolic PolyRule Reasoning",
    "Short Hypothesis": "Transformer models, when augmented with explicit symbolic reasoning capabilities, can achieve and surpass state-of-the-art performance in the Symbolic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) task by effectively learning and generalizing complex logical rules.",
    "Related Work": "Existing literature on neural-symbolic integration, such as Neural Turing Machines (Graves et al., 2014) and the Neural-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning Framework (Garcez et al., 2019), highlights the potential of combining neural networks with symbolic systems. Recent works, such as 'A Mechanistic Analysis of a Transformer Trained on a Symbolic Multi-Step Reasoning Task' (Brinkmann et al., 2024) and 'Pretrained Language Models are Symbolic Mathematics Solvers too!' (Noorbakhsh et al., 2021), demonstrate the capabilities of transformers in symbolic reasoning tasks. However, the specific application to poly-factor rules and the SPR task remains underexplored, presenting a novel research opportunity.",
    "Abstract": "This proposal investigates the conceptual generalization capabilities of transformer models in the Symbolic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) task. The SPR task involves classifying sequences of abstract symbols governed by hidden poly-factor generation rules, encapsulating complex logical structures. We hypothesize that transformer models, augmented with explicit symbolic reasoning capabilities, can effectively learn and generalize these rules, achieving and surpassing state-of-the-art performance. To test this hypothesis, we will develop a novel transformer-based architecture that incorporates symbolic reasoning modules, inspired by recent advancements in neural-symbolic integration. The model will be trained and evaluated on the SPR_BENCH benchmark. We will compare the performance of our model against existing state-of-the-art approaches and analyze its ability to generalize across variations in vocabulary sizes, sequence lengths, and rule complexities. Our findings will contribute to the understanding of how transformer models can be enhanced with symbolic reasoning capabilities to tackle complex reasoning tasks.",

    "Risk Factors and Limitations": [
        "Model Complexity: The integration of symbolic reasoning modules may increase the model complexity, leading to longer training times and higher computational requirements.",
        "Overfitting: There is a risk of overfitting to specific symbolic patterns in the SPR_BENCH dataset, which may limit the model's ability to generalize to unseen patterns.",
        "Interpretability: While the augmented model aims to improve interpretability, there may still be challenges in fully understanding the decision-making process of the transformer-based architecture.",
        "Scalability: The proposed approach may face scalability challenges when applied to larger datasets or more complex symbolic reasoning tasks."
