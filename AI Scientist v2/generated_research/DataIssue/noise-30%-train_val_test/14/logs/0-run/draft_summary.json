  "Experiment_description": "The experiments involve implementing and evaluating a Transformer-based sequence classification model on the SPR_BENCH dataset across various nodes. Each node employs a 2-layer Transformer encoder with 4 heads and 128-dimensional embeddings, focusing on achieving high Macro-F1 scores and minimizing loss.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are crucial as they highlight the challenges of overfitting in Transformer models and the necessity of balancing model complexity with generalization. The findings can guide future iterations in improving the model's ability to generalize, impacting how similar models are designed and optimized for sequence classification tasks.",
  "Description": "The experiments conducted a sequence classification task using a Transformer-based architecture. Each node loaded the SPR_BENCH dataset, encoded sequences, and utilized a 2-layer, 4-head Transformer encoder with 128-dimensional embeddings. The models were trained using cross-entropy loss, evaluated with Macro-F1 scores, and tracked for analysis. All implementations were optimized for GPU and aimed to establish a robust baseline for future improvements.",

      "description": "The loss curves indicate that the model is overfitting. The training loss decreases steadily and approaches zero, while the validation loss remains high.",
      "analysis": "The lack of improvement in validation loss suggests the model's complexity may be too high for the task, necessitating regularization or simplification."
