  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The successful tuning of the `d_model` parameter (Transformer hidden/embedding size) demonstrated the importance of systematically exploring hyperparameters. The grid search over different `d_model` values led to successful training and evaluation, with results logged and saved without issues.\n\n- **Symbolic Feature Integration**: Experiments that integrated symbolic features into the Transformer architecture showed promising results. For instance, adding a lightweight symbolic feature branch or a symbolic token that the Transformer can attend to resulted in models that performed close to the state-of-the-art accuracy.\n\n- **Multi-task Learning**: Incorporating auxiliary tasks, such as masked-language-model (MLM) objectives, alongside the primary classification task, helped improve the model's internal representation and rule generalization accuracy. This approach encouraged the network to capture both local symbolic regularities and global class distinctions.\n\n- **Efficient Execution**: All successful experiments were executed efficiently, with scripts that were self-contained, GPU-aware, and completed within a reasonable time frame. This indicates the importance of optimizing code for performance and resource management.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Dataset Availability**: A common failure was the absence of required dataset files, leading to FileNotFoundErrors. Ensuring that the dataset is correctly located and accessible is crucial for successful execution.\n\n- **Parameter Mismatches**: Errors such as ValueErrors occurred when parameters like the 'take' parameter exceeded the dataset size. Proper validation of parameter values against dataset characteristics can prevent such issues.\n\n- **Method Signature Inconsistencies**: TypeErrors arose when method signatures did not match the expected arguments, such as the `forward` method not accepting a `training` keyword argument. Ensuring consistency in method signatures and function calls is essential.\n\n- **Device Mismatch**: RuntimeErrors due to device mismatches, where tensors were on different devices (CPU vs. GPU), highlighted the need for careful device management. Ensuring that all tensors are on the same device can prevent such errors.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Robust Dataset Management**: Verify the presence and correct path of all required dataset files before execution. Implement checks to ensure datasets are loaded correctly and handle missing files gracefully.\n\n- **Comprehensive Parameter Validation**: Implement validation checks for parameter values, especially those dependent on dataset characteristics, to prevent runtime errors.\n\n- **Consistent Method Signatures**: Ensure that method signatures match expected function calls. Consider using default arguments or handling unused arguments to maintain compatibility.\n\n- **Unified Device Handling**: Standardize device management by ensuring all tensors and operations are consistently placed on the same device. Use device-agnostic code to facilitate seamless execution across different hardware configurations.\n\n- **Leverage Symbolic Features**: Continue exploring the integration of symbolic features, as they have shown potential in improving model performance. Experiment with different ways of embedding and utilizing symbolic information.\n\n- **Optimize Multi-task Learning**: Further investigate multi-task learning setups, as they have been effective in enhancing model generalization. Experiment with different auxiliary tasks and loss weightings to find optimal configurations.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes and avoid the common pitfalls observed in past attempts."
