        "Img_review": "The figure is inadequate and does not provide any meaningful information. It should be replaced with a proper visualization representing training-validation accuracy divergence and a confusion matrix, as described in the caption and text references.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption does not match the image at all. It describes phenomena (overfitting, accuracy divergence, label misclassification) that are entirely absent in the image. The caption must be revised once a proper figure is created.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The references in the main text describe the figure as if it includes meaningful visual elements (e.g., a confusion matrix and divergence of training-validation accuracy). Since the current image lacks these, the references are misleading and need to be updated."

    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The provided image is a placeholder named 'symbolic_transformer.png' and does not contain any actual figure or data for analysis.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is missing, so it is impossible to analyze its elements, contents, or quality. Once the figure is included, it should be reviewed for clarity, completeness, and alignment with the text.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption attempts to describe the figure as a confusion matrix showing performance inconsistencies and overfitting mitigation. While the length is reasonable, its accuracy and clarity cannot be confirmed without the actual figure.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The references in the main text provide detailed context for Figure 2, describing its purpose and findings. However, since the figure is absent, it is not possible to verify whether these references align with it."

        "Img_description": "The image contains only a placeholder text 'ablation_results.png' and lacks any graphical content, data, or annotations.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is entirely missing, rendering it impossible to convey any information to the reader. This is a critical flaw as the ablation comparisons and their impact on validation Macro-F1 cannot be evaluated or visualized.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption claims to describe ablation comparisons and their effects on validation Macro-F1. However, without an actual figure, the alignment of the caption with the image cannot be verified. The caption is concise but ineffectual without the corresponding figure.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The provided text does not include references to the figure in the main text. Without these, it is unclear how the figure is contextualized or integrated into the paper's discussion. This is an additional issue that needs to be addressed."
