        "Img_description": "The figure is a placeholder with the text 'baseline_results.png' and contains no graphical content or data.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is completely missing, making it impossible to evaluate or draw any conclusions about its content. A proper figure with performance curves comparing training and validation metrics should be included. Elements such as labeled axes, legends, and clear graphical representation are essential for accurate interpretation.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption describes a figure that is not present. It mentions performance curves for training and validation, with an observation about training improvement and stagnant validation performance. Without the actual figure, it is impossible to verify the caption's accuracy or relevance. The caption itself is concise and would be appropriate if the described figure were included.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure and provides context about overfitting due to symbolic augmentation. However, without the actual figure, these references cannot be verified or adequately assessed. The references would be informative if accompanied by a valid figure that aligns with the described content."

    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The image is a placeholder with the text 'symbolic_augmented.png' and does not contain any illustrative content.",
        "Img_review": "The image is a placeholder and does not provide any scientific or visual information about a confusion matrix or related performance trends. A proper figure should replace the placeholder, showing data and trends relevant to the caption. Without actual content, the figure fails to contribute to the paper's claims.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption describes an illustrative confusion matrix and mentions localized performance improvements and drops. However, the placeholder image does not validate or illustrate these claims. The caption is reasonably concise but irrelevant due to the placeholder image.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The references in the main text are empty (`[]`), providing no context or explanation for the figure. This hinders the reader's ability to understand or connect the figure to the narrative. The main text must include detailed references explaining the figure's content, context, and significance."
