  "Experiment_description": "The experiments involved establishing a lightweight Transformer baseline for sequence classification using the SPR_BENCH dataset. Different nodes explored symbol-level and whitespace tokenization strategies, employing a 2-layer TransformerEncoder and evaluating performance through loss metrics and macro-F1 scores.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are crucial as they establish a foundational understanding of the baseline model's strengths and limitations, particularly its tendency to overfit. Addressing these issues is vital for improving the model's generalization capabilities and guiding future enhancements.",
  "Description": "The nodes experimented with tokenizing sequences either at the symbol or whitespace level, using 2-layer TransformerEncoders with embeddings and positional encodings. Training was monitored for loss and macro-F1 scores, revealing consistent patterns of overfitting across different runs.",
