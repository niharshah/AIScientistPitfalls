  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Successful experiments often involved systematic hyperparameter tuning, such as varying dropout rates. This approach led to consistent performance improvements, as seen in the dropout tuning experiment where macro F1 scores remained stable across different configurations.\n\n- **Neuro-Symbolic Fusion:** Integrating symbolic features with neural networks proved effective. Experiments that combined symbolic statistics with Transformer models consistently achieved high macro F1 scores. This fusion allowed models to leverage both local token patterns and global symbolic regularities, enhancing conceptual generalization.\n\n- **Efficient Execution and Resource Management:** Successful experiments were characterized by efficient code execution, often running within a short time frame and utilizing GPU resources effectively. This efficiency was crucial for iterative experimentation and rapid prototyping.\n\n- **Robustness to Dataset Availability:** Some experiments included mechanisms to handle missing datasets by generating synthetic data, ensuring that the training pipeline could proceed without interruption. This adaptability contributed to the success of these experiments.\n\n- **Comprehensive Metric Tracking:** Successful experiments meticulously tracked various metrics, including training, validation, and test losses and macro F1 scores. This comprehensive tracking facilitated detailed performance analysis and informed subsequent experimental adjustments.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Dataset Availability Issues:** A recurring failure pattern was the absence of the required dataset (SPR_BENCH), leading to execution errors. This issue often resulted from incorrect dataset paths or missing files, causing FileNotFoundError or AssertionError.\n\n- **Lack of Dataset Path Configuration:** Experiments that did not configure dataset paths correctly or failed to check for dataset availability before execution encountered errors. This oversight led to abrupt script terminations and hindered experimental progress.\n\n- **Insufficient Error Handling:** Some failed experiments lacked robust error handling mechanisms, which could have mitigated issues related to missing datasets or incorrect configurations. This deficiency resulted in preventable execution failures.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Dataset Management:** Ensure that all experiments include checks for dataset availability and correct path configurations. Implement automatic dataset generation or download scripts to handle missing datasets seamlessly.\n\n- **Prioritize Hyperparameter Tuning:** Continue to emphasize systematic hyperparameter tuning, as it has consistently led to performance improvements. Consider automating this process to explore a broader range of configurations efficiently.\n\n- **Expand Neuro-Symbolic Integration:** Further explore the integration of symbolic features with neural networks. Experiment with different symbolic feature sets and fusion strategies to enhance model generalization and performance.\n\n- **Implement Robust Error Handling:** Develop comprehensive error handling routines to address common issues like missing datasets or incorrect configurations. This approach will improve the resilience of experimental scripts and reduce downtime.\n\n- **Optimize Resource Utilization:** Continue to focus on efficient resource management, ensuring that experiments run within reasonable time frames and make optimal use of available hardware, such as GPUs.\n\nBy addressing these areas, future experiments can build on past successes, avoid common pitfalls, and drive further advancements in model performance and generalization."
