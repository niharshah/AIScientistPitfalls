  "current_findings": "### Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n1. **Hybrid Models with Symbolic Components**: Successful experiments often integrated symbolic reasoning components with traditional Transformer architectures. For instance, models that combined token embeddings with symbolic representations, such as count-vectors or bigram signatures, showed improved performance in terms of F1 scores.\n\n2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic tuning of hyperparameters, such as the number of encoder layers, played a crucial role in optimizing model performance. For example, using 2 encoder layers was found to be effective in several experiments.\n\n3. **Multitask Learning**: Incorporating auxiliary tasks, such as next-token prediction, encouraged the model to internalize hidden rules rather than merely memorizing class labels. This approach improved the model's abstraction capabilities.\n\n4. **Early Stopping and Regularization**: Successful experiments employed early stopping based on validation metrics to prevent overfitting. Regularization techniques like dropout and weight decay were also utilized to enhance generalization.\n\n5. **Efficient Training**: Keeping the model lightweight and ensuring fast training times (e.g., within 30 minutes on a single GPU) was a common feature of successful experiments, allowing for rapid iteration and testing.\n\n### Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n1. **Lack of Generalization**: A recurring issue was the model's inability to generalize to unseen bigram combinations, as indicated by a systematic generalization accuracy (SGA) of 0.0000 across many experiments. This suggests a need for better handling of out-of-distribution data.\n\n2. **Overfitting**: Some models showed increasing validation and test losses over epochs, indicating overfitting to the training data. This was often due to the model exploiting shortcuts, such as memorizing bag-of-symbols representations.\n\n3. **Ineffective Symbolic Integration**: In some cases, the symbolic reasoning components did not effectively contribute to the model's performance. This was evident when symbolic modules failed to improve generalization or when ablation studies were not conducted to verify their impact.\n\n4. **Insufficient Data Diversity**: The lack of diverse training data led to poor generalization, as models struggled with sequences containing unseen factors.\n\n### Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n1. **Enhance Symbolic Reasoning**: Focus on improving the integration and effectiveness of symbolic reasoning components. Conduct thorough ablation studies to ensure these components contribute positively to model performance.\n\n2. **Improve Generalization**: Address the generalization issue by augmenting the training dataset with more diverse sequences, especially those containing unseen bigram combinations. Consider explicitly training the model on out-of-distribution data.\n\n3. **Regularization and Early Stopping**: Continue using regularization techniques and early stopping based on validation metrics to prevent overfitting. Experiment with different regularization strategies to find the most effective ones.\n\n4. **Experiment with Multitask Learning**: Further explore multitask learning approaches that encourage the model to learn underlying rules rather than memorizing data. This could involve additional auxiliary tasks or modified loss functions.\n\n5. **Optimize Hyperparameters**: Continue systematic hyperparameter tuning, especially focusing on the number of encoder layers, dropout rates, and learning rates, to find optimal configurations for different model architectures.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes and learn from the failures to develop more robust and generalizable models."
