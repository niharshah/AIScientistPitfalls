  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hybrid Model Design**: The integration of a symbolic head alongside the transformer representation proved to be a successful design choice. This neural-symbolic hybrid model allowed for both sequential and symbolic reasoning, which was effective in achieving high F1 scores on the test set.\n\n- **Consistent Training and Evaluation Pipeline**: Successful experiments maintained a consistent training and evaluation pipeline, including early stopping mechanisms and proper metric logging. This consistency ensured reliable comparisons across different experimental setups.\n\n- **Effective Use of Ablations**: Various ablation studies were conducted to isolate the effects of different model components. These studies helped identify the contributions of specific model parts, such as the symbol-count branch and positional encoding, to the overall performance.\n\n- **Data Handling Improvements**: Addressing issues like sequence truncation and ensuring that all symbols were retained in the data pipeline led to improvements in model accuracy, as seen in the experiment that fixed the sequence truncation bug.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Lack of Systematic Generalization**: A recurring issue across both successful and failed experiments was the inability to achieve systematic generalization to out-of-distribution bigrams, as indicated by the SGA metric consistently being 0.0000.\n\n- **Suboptimal Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fluctuating validation F1 scores and early stopping without significant improvement suggest that hyperparameter tuning, such as learning rate adjustments, was not optimal in some cases.\n\n- **Overfitting**: The failure to generalize to unseen patterns suggests overfitting to the training data. This was particularly evident in experiments that did not incorporate sufficient regularization or data diversity.\n\n- **Neglecting Alternative Architectures**: The experiments that replaced the transformer with other architectures, like the BiGRU, failed to achieve systematic generalization, indicating a potential mismatch between the architecture and the task requirements.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Generalization**: Focus on improving systematic generalization by incorporating data augmentation techniques, increasing the diversity of training data, and experimenting with alternative architectures or symbolic reasoning modules that can better handle out-of-distribution generalization.\n\n- **Optimize Hyperparameters**: Conduct thorough hyperparameter tuning, particularly focusing on learning rates and dropout rates, to stabilize validation performance and prevent overfitting.\n\n- **Regularization Techniques**: Introduce regularization terms in the loss function to penalize overfitting and encourage the model to learn more generalized patterns.\n\n- **Explore Alternative Architectures**: While the transformer-based models showed promise, exploring other architectures or hybrid models that integrate symbolic reasoning could provide better generalization capabilities.\n\n- **Detailed Error Analysis**: Perform in-depth error analysis to identify specific patterns or data points where the model fails, and use these insights to guide model improvements and data preprocessing strategies.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes and learn from the failures to achieve more robust and generalizable models."
