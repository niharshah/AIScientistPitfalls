        "Img_description": "The image is a placeholder labeled 'training_validation_loss.png' and contains no visual content for analysis.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is a placeholder and does not provide any details such as axes, curves, or legends. As such, no meaningful analysis can be made. To improve, provide the actual figure with clear labeling for axes, legends, and sufficient resolution to analyze trends in training and validation losses.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption states, 'Training vs. validation loss: the gap widens significantly.' While this is concise and provides a hint at the figure's intent, the accuracy and meaningfulness of the caption cannot be assessed without the actual figure. If the figure matches the caption, consider adding a concise takeaway to clarify the implications of the widening gap.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references are clear and describe the expected trends in training and validation losses (e.g., plateauing of validation loss and continued decline of training loss). However, the validity of these references cannot be assessed without the actual figure. Ensure the provided figure visually supports these claims."
