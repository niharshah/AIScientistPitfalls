  "current_findings": "### Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Successful experiments often involved systematic hyperparameter tuning, such as grid-searching batch sizes. This approach allowed for the identification of optimal configurations that improved model performance, as evidenced by the successful tuning of batch sizes (32, 64, 128, 256) which led to different training and validation losses and macro F1 scores.\n\n- **Integration of Symbolic Reasoning**: Experiments that integrated symbolic reasoning components, such as symbolic heads or reasoning vectors, showed promise in enhancing model performance. For instance, the SymbolicTransformer achieved a higher final Dev Macro F1 score compared to the TinyTransformer, indicating the potential benefits of incorporating symbolic reasoning.\n\n- **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Successful experiments were designed to run efficiently on both CPU and GPU, with models being lightweight and scripts adhering to device handling guidelines. This ensured that experiments could be executed within reasonable time frames and resource constraints.\n\n- **Robust Logging and Metric Tracking**: Consistent logging of metrics, losses, predictions, and ground-truth labels into structured data formats (e.g., `experiment_data.npy`) was a common practice in successful experiments. This facilitated thorough analysis and comparison of results across different configurations.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Dataset Path Issues**: A recurring issue in failed experiments was the incorrect specification of dataset paths, leading to FileNotFoundErrors. This was often due to assumptions about the dataset's location relative to the working directory.\n\n- **Dataset Size Assumptions**: Several failures were attributed to incorrect assumptions about dataset sizes, resulting in IndexErrors when attempting to subsample more data than available. This highlights the importance of dynamically checking dataset sizes before subsampling.\n\n- **Environment and Variable Management**: Failures were sometimes caused by improper handling of environment variables and directory paths, which led to scripts being unable to locate necessary files.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Dynamic Dataset Handling**: Implement robust dataset handling mechanisms that dynamically check for dataset existence and size. Use environment variables to specify dataset paths, and ensure that subsampling limits are set based on actual dataset sizes.\n\n- **Enhanced Symbolic Reasoning**: Continue exploring and refining symbolic reasoning components, as they have shown potential in improving model performance. Future experiments could focus on more sophisticated symbolic reasoning modules and their integration with neural architectures.\n\n- **Comprehensive Hyperparameter Exploration**: Maintain systematic hyperparameter tuning as a standard practice. Consider expanding the range of hyperparameters explored, such as learning rates and model architectures, to uncover more optimal configurations.\n\n- **Improved Error Handling and Logging**: Enhance error handling to provide informative messages that guide debugging efforts. Ensure that logging is comprehensive and structured to facilitate easy analysis and comparison of experimental results.\n\n- **Resource Efficiency**: Design experiments to be resource-efficient, ensuring they can run on both CPU and GPU. This includes using lightweight models and adhering to device handling guidelines to maximize accessibility and execution speed.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, future experiments can build on past successes while mitigating common pitfalls, leading to more robust and insightful research outcomes."
