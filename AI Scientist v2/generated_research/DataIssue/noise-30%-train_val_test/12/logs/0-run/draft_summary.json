  "Experiment_description": "Multiple nodes conducted experiments to establish a character-level text classification baseline using small Transformer encoders on the SPR_BENCH dataset. These experiments aimed to create a foundation for future enhancement with symbolic reasoning components.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are crucial for setting a baseline for future advancements in the field of symbolic reasoning in text classification. The findings provide insights into the challenges of overfitting and class imbalance in character-level models, guiding future research directions.",
  "Description": "The experiments involved training small Transformer encoder models on character-encoded sequences from the SPR_BENCH dataset. The process included building vocabularies, encoding sequences, and training models while monitoring cross-entropy loss and macro F1 scores. The aim was to establish a reproducible baseline, with all processes optimized for GPU usage and results saved for analysis.",
