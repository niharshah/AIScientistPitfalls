  "Experiment_description": "The experiments conducted across the nodes focus on establishing a reproducible baseline using lightweight transformer encoder models to process symbolic sequences from the SPR_BENCH dataset. The nodes test variations in transformer configurations and observe the impact on performance metrics such as cross-entropy loss and Macro-F1 score.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are crucial for establishing a foundational model that can be built upon for more sophisticated reasoning tasks in future research. The findings highlight the robustness of the lightweight transformer approach, achieving consistent performance metrics across different configurations, which is essential for future developments in symbolic sequence processing.",
  "Description": "Each node implements a lightweight transformer encoder to process symbolic sequences from the SPR_BENCH dataset. The sequences are encoded as integer tokens and fed into a transformer model, followed by a linear classifier. The models are trained using the Adam optimizer and evaluated using metrics such as cross-entropy loss and Macro-F1 score. The experiments aim to establish a reproducible baseline for future enhancements and exploratory phases.",
