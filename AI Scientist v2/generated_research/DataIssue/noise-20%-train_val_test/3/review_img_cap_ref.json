        "Img_description": "The image contains only placeholder text 'baseline_aggregated.png' with no graphical or scientific content.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is missing or improperly embedded in the manuscript. As a result, no meaningful analysis of the figure's content can be performed. This is a critical issue as it prevents the reader from understanding the data or conclusions associated with the figure.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption, 'Baseline performance exhibits steep overfitting after early epochs,' is untestable against the provided image due to the absence of actual content. No judgment can be made about its accuracy or conciseness.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The references in the main text pointing to this figure are empty ([]). Without proper figure content or explanatory context in the main text, the integration of this figure into the paper is severely lacking. This requires immediate correction for clarity and completeness."
    },
    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The image appears to be a placeholder or improperly loaded graphic labeled 'research_aggregated.png.' It contains no discernible visual components such as axes, data points, graphs, or labels.",
        "Img_review": "The figure lacks any meaningful content or visual data to analyze. It seems to be a placeholder or error. To improve, replace the placeholder with the intended graph or figure, including properly labeled axes, data points, and relevant annotations.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption, 'Modified approach with partial mitigation. Gains are noticeable but not robust,' does not match the content of the image, as the image has no discernible content. The caption should be aligned to the actual figure and provide a concise and accurate summary of its content.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references to the figure are missing, as indicated by the '[]'. This leaves the figure without any context or integration into the discussion. Add meaningful figrefs to explain the content, purpose, and relevance of the figure."

    "figure_3": {
        "Img_description": "The image provided is a placeholder with the file name 'ablation_no_label_smoothing_f1_curve.png'. No visual content is available for analysis.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is missing, which is a critical issue. The submission must include the actual figure to allow for proper evaluation. Without it, I cannot assess whether it is clear, informative, or aligns with the claims in the caption.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption suggests that the figure demonstrates the improvement of F1 scores due to label smoothing, with gaps remaining in shifted conditions. While concise, the caption cannot be verified due to the missing figure. It also lacks specific details about the visualization, such as the axes or quantitative changes.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references to the figure are completely missing ('[]'). This is a significant flaw, as the figure is not integrated into the discussion or contextualized. Proper references and explanations are essential for clarity and comprehension."
