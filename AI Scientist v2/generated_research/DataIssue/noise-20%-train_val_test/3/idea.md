## Title

Contextual Embedding-Based Learning for Complex Symbolic Rule Reasoning

## Short Hypothesis

Can contextual embeddings, traditionally used in NLP tasks, be adapted to improve the performance of Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) by capturing intricate dependencies and patterns within symbolic sequences?

## Related Work

Most existing approaches for reasoning tasks focus on either end-to-end deep learning methods or symbolic reasoning frameworks. While transformer-based models like BERT and GPT have revolutionized NLP by capturing contextual dependencies, their application to purely symbolic reasoning tasks remains underexplored. Current state-of-the-art models for SPR_BENCH achieve an accuracy of 80.0%, indicating a significant room for improvement. This proposal aims to bridge the gap between symbolic reasoning and contextual embedding techniques.

## Abstract

Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) tasks, which involve classifying sequences of abstract symbols according to hidden complex rules, pose a significant challenge in automated reasoning. This proposal investigates the adaptation of contextual embeddings, specifically designed for natural language processing, to enhance the performance of SPR tasks. By leveraging the ability of contextual embeddings to capture dependencies within sequences, we hypothesize that the proposed model will outperform existing state-of-the-art methods on the SPR_BENCH benchmark. The study will involve developing a transformer-based model that integrates symbolic reasoning capabilities with contextual embeddings. The model will be trained and evaluated on the SPR_BENCH dataset, with a focus on improving accuracy over the existing 80.0% SOTA. This research could lead to significant advancements in automated reasoning systems, with applications in domains requiring complex symbolic pattern recognition.

## Experiments

- {'title': 'Training and Evaluation', 'description': 'Train the model on the train split of the SPR_BENCH dataset. Tune hyperparameters on the dev split. Evaluate the final model on the test split and compare the performance with the SOTA baseline.'}
- {'title': 'Ablation Studies', 'description': 'Investigate the impact of removing or altering specific components (e.g., shape-count handling, color-position dependencies) on model performance. Compare different embedding strategies (e.g., character-level vs. token-level embeddings).'}
- {'title': 'Generalization Analysis', 'description': 'Test the model on variations of the SPR_BENCH dataset with different vocabulary sizes, sequence lengths, and rule complexities to assess generalization capabilities.'}

## Risk Factors And Limitations

1. Overfitting: The model may overfit the training data, leading to poor generalization. Regularization techniques and careful hyperparameter tuning will be essential. 2. Computational Complexity: Transformer-based models are computationally intensive, which may limit scalability. Efficient training techniques and model optimization will be crucial. 3. Symbolic Nature: The inherent difference between natural language and symbolic sequences might pose challenges in effectively adapting contextual embeddings. Custom embedding strategies and model adjustments will be necessary.
