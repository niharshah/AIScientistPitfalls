  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Successful experiments often involved fine-tuning hyperparameters such as dropout rates, which helped in achieving better generalization and performance metrics.\n\n- **Model Architecture Enhancements**: Incorporating explicit [CLS] tokens and increasing model capacity (e.g., deeper layers, more heads) consistently led to improved performance. These changes allowed models to capture more complex dependencies and provided richer contextual embeddings.\n\n- **Auxiliary Tasks**: Introducing auxiliary tasks like sequence-length parity and counting distinct symbols helped models internalize rule-critical statistics, leading to better performance. This multi-task approach provided additional supervision signals that enriched the model's representations.\n\n- **Regularization Techniques**: The use of label-smoothing and dropout was effective in reducing over-confidence and improving generalization. These techniques helped in achieving lower validation and test losses.\n\n- **Tokenization Strategies**: Switching from character-level to token-level embeddings, especially with space-delimited tokens, improved the model's ability to respect atomic symbolic units, leading to better contextual understanding.\n\n- **Monitoring and Early Stopping**: Employing metrics like Macro-F1 for early stopping ensured that models did not overfit and maintained generalization capabilities.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Lack of Proper Regularization**: Experiments without adequate regularization techniques like dropout or label-smoothing often resulted in overfitting, leading to poor generalization on test data.\n\n- **Insufficient Model Capacity**: Models with inadequate depth or insufficient number of attention heads struggled to capture complex dependencies, resulting in suboptimal performance.\n\n- **Ignoring Auxiliary Tasks**: Experiments that did not leverage auxiliary tasks missed out on the benefits of enriched representations and often underperformed compared to those that did.\n\n- **Inadequate Hyperparameter Tuning**: Failing to explore a wide range of hyperparameters, especially dropout rates, led to models that were either too rigid or too prone to overfitting.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Expand Hyperparameter Search**: Future experiments should include a broader range of hyperparameters, particularly focusing on dropout rates, learning rates, and model capacity parameters.\n\n- **Enhance Model Architectures**: Continue to explore deeper and more complex architectures with additional layers and attention heads. Consider experimenting with different types of positional encodings and embedding strategies.\n\n- **Leverage Auxiliary Tasks**: Incorporate more auxiliary tasks that align with the main task's objectives. This could include tasks that encourage models to learn additional statistical properties relevant to the main task.\n\n- **Regularization and Early Stopping**: Implement robust regularization techniques and use metrics like Macro-F1 for early stopping to prevent overfitting and ensure better generalization.\n\n- **Tokenization and Embedding Strategies**: Further investigate tokenization strategies that align with the symbolic nature of the data. Experiment with different embedding techniques to capture richer contextual information.\n\n- **Iterative Experimentation**: Adopt an iterative approach to experimentation, where insights from each experiment are used to refine and improve subsequent experiments. This includes learning from both successful and failed experiments to continuously enhance model performance."
