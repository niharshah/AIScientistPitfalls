    "Summary": "This paper explores pitfalls in sequence modeling, focusing on real-world deployment challenges such as data distribution mismatches and fragile design choices. The authors evaluate a transformer-based architecture with a refined attention mechanism but highlight its shortcomings in dynamic conditions.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The topic of robustness and reliability in sequence modeling is important and relevant.",
        "The paper raises awareness of real-world challenges, such as data distribution shifts and architectural fragility, which are legitimate concerns in sequence modeling."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper lacks clarity and detail in describing its methodology. For instance, the 'refined attention strategy' is not adequately explained, making it difficult to assess the novelty or validity of the proposed approach.",
        "The experiments are poorly presented. Figures are unclear, and there is no substantial quantitative evidence to support the claims. For example, the confusion matrices and learning curves lack proper labels, metrics, and analysis.",
        "The related work section is incomplete, with placeholders ('**?**') instead of proper citations, significantly undermining the paper's credibility.",
        "The results presented are vague and do not provide actionable insights or concrete solutions to the identified pitfalls.",
        "The paper fails to address its limitations, potential societal impact, or ethical concerns.",
        "The writing is disorganized and lacks coherence, making it difficult to follow the narrative."

    "Questions": [
        "What exactly is the 'refined attention strategy' introduced in the research model? Please provide a detailed description.",
        "Why does the related work section have placeholder citations ('**?**')? This is unacceptable for a submission to a major venue.",
        "Can the authors provide more detailed and clear experimental results, including proper metrics, labeled figures, and statistical analysis?",
        "What are the specific contributions of this paper to the field of sequence modeling? How do they go beyond general observations already known in the literature?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not adequately discuss its own limitations or the broader implications of its findings. For example, how generalizable are the identified pitfalls to other model architectures or tasks?"
