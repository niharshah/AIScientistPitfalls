        "Img_review": "The actual figure is missing, preventing any detailed analysis of its contents or evaluation of its quality. Without the figure, I cannot assess the adequacy of elements such as axis labels, legends, or trends.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption describes a figure showing training (blue) and validation (orange) accuracy trends, highlighting a growing discrepancy over epochs indicative of overfitting. While the description is concise and appears scientifically valid, its accuracy cannot be verified without the actual figure.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references provide adequate context for the figure's content, discussing its trends and implications within the study's scope. However, without the figure, these references cannot be validated for accuracy or completeness."

    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The image is a placeholder labeled 'confusion_matrix.png' and does not contain any actual data or visual representation of a confusion matrix. It lacks axes, labels, values, or any graphical content.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is non-informative as it is a placeholder. It fails to present any useful information or visualization for the reader. To address this issue, a proper confusion matrix should be included, showing class-wise predictions, actual values, and any misclassifications (e.g., with color coding or numerical values). Additionally, axis labels and a legend would be necessary to interpret the data effectively.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption appears to describe an intended confusion matrix, indicating persistent misclassifications for certain classes. While the caption is concise and informative, it cannot be validated or evaluated against the placeholder image. If the actual confusion matrix were present, the caption might need refinement to highlight specific observations or patterns visible in the data.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references provide adequate context for the intended purpose of Figure 2, outlining its role in illustrating consistent misclassifications in symbolic examples. However, due to the absence of a proper figure, the references cannot be fully assessed for alignment. Once the actual figure is included, the references should be reviewed to ensure they accurately describe the figure's content and insights."
