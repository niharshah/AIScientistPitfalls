    "Summary": "The paper examines the failure modes of transformer models on symbolic reasoning tasks, particularly highlighting overfitting and generalization issues. It identifies that transformers perform well on training data but fail to generalize to out-of-distribution examples in symbolic tasks. The paper provides an empirical investigation of these pitfalls and suggests that solving such challenges requires further research into specialized architectures or training protocols.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper addresses the important problem of generalization in symbolic reasoning tasks, which is underexplored in the context of transformers.",
        "The empirical results are intuitive and reinforce known issues with transformers, such as overfitting and the inability to handle distribution shifts effectively."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The contributions are limited to identifying problems without offering concrete solutions or significant insights into addressing the challenges.",
        "The experimental setup lacks depth, as it only superficially explores a small set of symbolic tasks without investigating diverse datasets or architectures.",
        "The paper does not provide detailed explanations of why these failure modes occur, nor does it thoroughly analyze the limitations of transformers in symbolic reasoning.",
        "The clarity of the paper is subpar, with vague descriptions and a lack of technical rigor in presenting methods and results.",
        "The discussion on architectural modifications or training protocols is minimal and speculative, with no concrete proposals or experiments to support them."

    "Questions": [
        "Can the authors provide a more detailed analysis of why transformers fail on symbolic tasks? For instance, does the overfitting stem from the model architecture, training procedure, or lack of suitable inductive biases?",
        "Have alternative architectures, such as those explicitly designed for symbolic reasoning (e.g., graph neural networks), been evaluated for comparison?",
        "What steps did the authors take to ensure that the datasets used in the experiments are representative of real-world symbolic tasks?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper lacks a detailed analysis of the root causes behind the observed failures, which limits its impact.",
        "The experiments are restricted to a narrow range of symbolic tasks, reducing the generalizability of the findings.",
        "The proposed future directions are vague and lack actionable insights or experimental evidence."
