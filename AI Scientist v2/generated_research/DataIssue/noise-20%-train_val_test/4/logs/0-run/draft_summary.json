  "Experiment_description": "The experiments involve establishing a robust baseline using a lightweight Transformer encoder with 4 layers, 4 heads, and a hidden size of 128 on the SPR_BENCH dataset. This setup processes sequence data by building a character-level vocabulary, converting sequences into integer tensors, and training with cross-entropy loss over ten epochs. Mean-pooling and a linear classifier are used for sequence classification, with performance evaluated via Macro-F1 and validation loss metrics.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are significant as they establish a reliable baseline for sequence classification using a Transformer encoder, demonstrating effective generalization and unbiased predictions across classes. The findings lay the groundwork for future experiments and improvements, particularly in the domain of symbolic reasoning and more sophisticated model enhancements.",
  "Description": "The experiments uniformly apply a Transformer encoder with specified architecture to process SPR_BENCH data. Sequences are converted into integer tensors, and models are trained over ten epochs using cross-entropy loss. Performance is tracked via validation loss and Macro-F1 scores, with checkpoints saved based on development F1. Results and predictions are stored for analysis, and plots are generated for visual inspection.",
