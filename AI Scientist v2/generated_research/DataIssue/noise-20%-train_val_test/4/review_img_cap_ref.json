        "Img_description": "The image is a placeholder labeled 'baseline_loss_curves.png' and does not contain any graphical elements, axes, or data points to analyze.",
        "Img_review": "The image lacks meaningful content, such as labeled axes, data points, or curves. It is a placeholder and does not provide the information necessary to evaluate training loss curves. It should be replaced with a proper figure that aligns with the caption and described content.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption claims that the figure shows training loss curves for baseline Transformer experiments, with convergence plateauing early. However, the image does not contain any such information. The caption does not match the image and cannot be evaluated further due to the lack of content in the image.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The references in the main text describe training curves, saturation, and convergence issues well, but they cannot be meaningfully connected to the placeholder image. The absence of a proper figure undermines the coherence of these references. A proper figure is required to evaluate these connections."
