    "figure_1": {
        "Img_description": "The image contains two subplots: the top one shows an aggregated macro-F1 curve, and the bottom one shows an aggregated loss curve. Both plots illustrate trends over what appears to be training epochs or iterations. The macro-F1 curve starts with a steep increase followed by a plateau, while the loss curve shows a steep decline followed by a plateau. There are no axis labels, legends, or variability indicators.",
        "Img_review": "The figure lacks essential elements like axis labels and legends, which severely limit interpretability. It is unclear what is being compared in the plots, as no indication of models or experimental runs is provided. There are no error bars or shaded regions to reflect variability across random seeds, which the text critiques. Adding these elements would improve clarity and align the figure with the main text discussion.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption accurately summarizes the overall trend (early plateauing of metrics) but lacks details about the axes or the figure's purpose. It is concise but could be expanded to include what the axes represent and highlight the comparison being made. This would make the caption more informative.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure as showing 'similar learning progress' across models, but this is unverifiable without a legend or annotations in the figure. The references generally align with the figure but fail to emphasize the lack of variability indicators or clarify what is being compared. Further details in the text could help contextualize the figure better."

    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The figure is a placeholder image with no visible graphical or tabular content. It is supposed to compare Test macro-F1 scores between a baseline and a proposed approach, but no content is present to analyze.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is entirely missing, which is a critical issue. Without the actual visual data, readers cannot verify or understand the claims made in the caption or text. Ensure that the figure is properly rendered and includes essential elements such as axis labels, legends, and clear data points.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption is concise and provides a brief takeaway ('Gains remain modest'), but it lacks sufficient detail. It should describe specific trends or differences shown in the figure to contextualize the 'modest gains' claim.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure but does not provide enough explanation of its contents. It mentions 'diminishing returns' and 'fragility of models' but does not describe the specific trends, data points, or comparisons that should be evident in the figure. This reliance on the figure alone is problematic if the figure lacks clarity or is missing."
