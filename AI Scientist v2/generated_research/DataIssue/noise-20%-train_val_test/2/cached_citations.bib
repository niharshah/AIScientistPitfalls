% The seminal work 'Attention is All You Need' introduces the transformer architecture, which is foundational to the proposed model for Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR). This paper will be cited in discussions about the use of transformer-based methods to process symbolic sequences and the integration of contextual embeddings with symbolic reasoning tasks.

% This paper analyzes the properties of contextual word embeddings, such as BERT and ELMo, and their ability to produce context-specific representations. It is relevant for supporting the theoretical basis of using contextual embeddings in symbolic reasoning tasks by demonstrating their capability to capture dependencies within sequences. This citation will be used when discussing the adaptation of contextual embeddings for SPR tasks and their theoretical underpinnings.

% The paper 'Interpretable Neural-Symbolic Concept Reasoning' introduces the Deep Concept Reasoner (DCR), an interpretable concept-based model that leverages syntactic rule structures and embeddings to provide semantically consistent predictions. This work is relevant for discussing the integration of symbolic reasoning with embedding-based approaches and will be cited when highlighting the gap in adapting contextual embeddings for symbolic reasoning tasks like SPR.
