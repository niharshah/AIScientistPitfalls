  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Incorporation of Symbolic-Count Features**: The integration of explicit symbolic-count features significantly boosts the performance of the Transformer model. This hybrid approach, which combines sequence-level representation with global rule cues, consistently improves Rule-Macro Accuracy (RMA) and overall accuracy.\n\n- **Effective Ablation Studies**: Several ablation experiments were conducted to understand the impact of different components. The experiments that retained some form of count features or positional embeddings generally performed better than those that did not.\n\n- **Robust Training and Evaluation Setup**: The use of label-smoothing, an aggressive One-Cycle learning-rate schedule, and comprehensive metric tracking (accuracy, MCC, RMA) contributed to the successful training and evaluation of models. These strategies helped in achieving better generalization and understanding the model's performance.\n\n- **Fallback Mechanism**: The implementation of a fallback to a synthetic dataset when SPR_BENCH is unavailable ensures that the experiments are always runnable, which is crucial for consistent testing and development.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Omission of Key Features**: Experiments that removed critical features, such as the positional embedding or the count vector, generally showed a decline in performance. This highlights the importance of these components in capturing the necessary information for sequence classification.\n\n- **Lack of Feature Projection**: The \"Raw-Count Concat (No Feature-Projection)\" ablation resulted in a failure to produce meaningful metrics. This suggests that the projection of count features into the same space as the sequence embeddings is crucial for effective model performance.\n\n- **Simplified Models**: Models like the \"Count-Only MLP\" that rely solely on global statistics without sequence-level representation learning showed reasonable but limited performance, indicating the necessity of combining both global and sequence-level features.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Maintain Hybrid Architecture**: Continue using the hybrid architecture that combines sequence embeddings with symbolic-count features. This approach has consistently shown improved performance and should be the foundation for future models.\n\n- **Enhance Feature Projection**: Ensure that count features are projected into the same space as sequence embeddings. This step is crucial for integrating different types of information and should not be omitted.\n\n- **Explore Alternative Positional Embeddings**: While learnable positional embeddings have shown success, exploring fixed sinusoidal embeddings or other alternatives could provide insights into the importance of positional information and potentially improve model robustness.\n\n- **Comprehensive Ablation Studies**: Conduct more targeted ablation studies to isolate the effects of individual components. This will help in understanding their contributions and optimizing the model architecture.\n\n- **Robustness to Dataset Variability**: Ensure that models are tested on both synthetic and real datasets to evaluate their robustness and generalization capabilities. This will help in identifying any overfitting to specific data characteristics.\n\nBy following these recommendations and building on the successful patterns observed, future experiments can achieve more robust and accurate models for sequence classification tasks."
