  "Experiment_description": "The experiments focus on SPR sequence classification using character-level GRU-based models. Nodes explore variations in GRU architectures such as simple vs. bidirectional GRUs, embedding layers, and different loss functions.",
  "Significance": "These experiments establish a baseline for SPR sequence classification, highlighting the effects of architectural choices like bidirectional GRUs on performance. The findings provide insights into overfitting and generalization challenges, informing future model refinement.",
  "Description": "Each experiment converts SPR sequences into integer-encoded strings and trains a GRU-based classifier, with some nodes using bidirectional GRUs. Loss functions vary between cross-entropy and BCEWithLogitsLoss. Key metrics like macro F1 score and loss are tracked over epochs, and models are evaluated on training, validation, and test datasets.",
