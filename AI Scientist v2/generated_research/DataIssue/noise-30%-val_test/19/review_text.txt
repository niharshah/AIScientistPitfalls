    "Summary": "This paper investigates the limitations of neural network architectures, specifically Transformer-based and CharBiGRU models, in symbolic PolyRule reasoning tasks. It highlights a persistent performance plateau of around 70% macro-F1 despite various interventions such as dropout tuning and ablation studies. The paper suggests that purely neural methods may be insufficient for symbolic reasoning tasks and proposes hybrid approaches as a future direction.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper identifies a clear problem in symbolic reasoning tasks and highlights the limitations of current neural approaches.",
        "It conducts experiments to analyze the plateau in performance, providing some empirical evidence to support its claims."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper does not propose a novel method or provide significant technical contributions.",
        "The analysis is minimal and lacks depth. For instance, the reasons behind the persistent performance ceiling are not thoroughly explored.",
        "The experimental setup is poorly described. Details about the dataset, hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics are sparse or missing.",
        "The ablation studies, while mentioned, do not provide meaningful insights or actionable conclusions.",
        "The writing is unclear, with insufficient explanations of key concepts and methods. For example, the description of the PolyRule task and dataset is vague.",
        "The paper provides only negative results without offering clear directions or concrete solutions."

    "Questions": [
        "What specific symbolic reasoning tasks are included in the PolyRule dataset, and how are they constructed?",
        "What are the precise hyperparameter settings and dataset statistics for the experiments?",
        "Have alternative architectures or non-neural methods been considered as baselines?",
        "Can you provide more detailed analysis of why the performance ceiling persists? For example, is it due to dataset complexity, model capacity, or optimization issues?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not adequately address why the proposed interventions fail to overcome the performance plateau.",
        "Potential negative societal impacts, if any, are not discussed.",
        "The lack of clarity and detail in the methodology limits the reproducibility of the results."
