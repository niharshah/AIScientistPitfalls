    "Summary": "The paper investigates challenges in applying deep neural networks to symbolic reasoning tasks, highlighting instabilities and partial progress that fails to generalize. It presents experiments with GRU and Transformer models on symbolic reasoning benchmarks to show performance issues related to changes in data distributions and hyperparameters.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses an important topic: the difficulty of symbolic reasoning with neural networks.",
        "Highlights the brittleness of current approaches, which is a relevant concern for real-world applications."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper lacks novelty as it primarily reiterates known issues with symbolic reasoning in neural networks.",
        "Methodological details are vague, making it difficult to assess the experiments or reproduce the results.",
        "The experiments are shallow and fail to propose or evaluate meaningful solutions to the identified challenges.",
        "The related work section is poorly cited, with placeholder references (e.g., '[**?**]').",
        "Figures and results lack sufficient analysis or insights beyond stating that instabilities exist.",
        "The conclusions are superficial, offering no actionable strategies or significant advancements for the community."
