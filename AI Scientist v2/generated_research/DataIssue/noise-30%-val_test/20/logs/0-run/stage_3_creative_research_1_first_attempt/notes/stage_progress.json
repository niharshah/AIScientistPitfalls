  "current_findings": "### Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Transformer Encoder Utilization**: Transitioning from GRU to a Transformer encoder consistently improved performance. The ability of Transformers to capture long-range dependencies and poly-factor relations was a significant advantage.\n\n- **Batch Size Optimization**: A batch size of 32 was repeatedly found to be optimal across multiple experiments, providing stable training and improved metrics.\n\n- **Complexity-Weighted Accuracy (CWA)**: Incorporating CWA as a metric, especially when weighted by sequence complexity, helped in better evaluating model performance on more complex sequences.\n\n- **Early Stopping and Learning Rate Scheduling**: Implementing early stopping based on validation loss and using cosine learning rate decay contributed to more efficient training and prevented overfitting.\n\n- **Auxiliary Tasks**: Adding self-supervised auxiliary tasks, such as length-parity and unique-symbol-count, guided the model representation towards features that mimic common predicates, enhancing reasoning ability.\n\n- **Curriculum Training**: Starting with down-weighted complex examples and gradually increasing their weight helped stabilize early learning and emphasized difficult rules later, boosting final CWA.\n\n- **Robustness to Dataset Absence**: The ability to fall back on synthetic datasets ensured that experiments could run in any environment, maintaining consistency in testing.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Logits Tensor Shape Issues**: A recurring issue was the incorrect shape of the logits tensor, leading to IndexErrors during metric computation. This often stemmed from mismatches in expected batch size or number of classes.\n\n- **Overfitting**: While not explicitly mentioned as a failure, the need for early stopping indicates that overfitting was a potential risk, especially with larger models or longer training without validation checks.\n\n- **Complexity Misestimation**: In the absence of explicit complexity columns, proxies like sequence length were used, which might not always accurately reflect true complexity, potentially skewing CWA calculations.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Ensure Logits Shape Consistency**: Before computing metrics, verify that the logits tensor has the correct dimensions. Implement checks or assertions to catch shape mismatches early in the training process.\n\n- **Continue Leveraging Transformer Architectures**: The success of Transformer models suggests further exploration of deeper or more complex architectures, possibly with more layers or enhanced positional encoding techniques.\n\n- **Refine Complexity Metrics**: If possible, improve the estimation of sequence complexity by incorporating more detailed features or metadata, rather than relying solely on proxies like sequence length.\n\n- **Experiment with Larger Batch Sizes**: While a batch size of 32 was optimal, exploring slightly larger sizes with adequate regularization might yield further improvements, especially with more complex models.\n\n- **Expand Auxiliary Tasks**: Introduce additional self-supervised tasks that align with the domain-specific predicates to further enhance model reasoning capabilities.\n\n- **Robustness and Flexibility**: Maintain the ability to run experiments with synthetic datasets to ensure robustness across different environments and data availability scenarios.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, future experiments can build on past successes while mitigating common pitfalls, leading to more robust and high-performing models."
