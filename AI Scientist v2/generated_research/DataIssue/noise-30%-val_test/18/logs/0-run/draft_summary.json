  "Experiment_description": "The experiments involved establishing a baseline for sequence classification using a lightweight RNN architecture. Each node implemented a single-layer Bi-LSTM model with max-pooling and a linear layer for classification, tracking cross-entropy loss and Macro-F1 score for performance evaluation.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are significant as they establish a robust, reproducible baseline for sequence classification, setting the groundwork for future explorations. The findings provide insights into model performance, generalization, and areas for improvement, guiding future research directions.",
  "Description": "The experiments utilized RNN architectures to classify symbol sequences. The process involved converting sequences to integer representations, using an Embedding layer, a single-layer Bi-LSTM, max-pooling, and a linear classification layer. Training tracked cross-entropy loss and Macro-F1 score over 5 epochs, with a focus on GPU efficiency through batch-wise padding.",

      "description": "The plot shows the training and validation loss over 5 epochs. The training loss decreases steadily, indicating that the model is learning from the training data. The validation loss initially decreases but starts to plateau and slightly decreases by the end of the training.",
      "analysis": "The loss curve indicates reasonable generalization but suggests potential overfitting or room for improvement in validation performance."
