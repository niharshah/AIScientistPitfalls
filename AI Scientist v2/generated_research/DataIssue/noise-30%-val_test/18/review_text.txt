    "Summary": "The paper highlights pitfalls in extending Transformer architectures to real-world tasks, focusing on challenges such as training instabilities and performance degradation during modularization experiments. The authors aim to share negative findings to foster robust Transformer design.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper addresses an underexplored but valuable topic: documenting and analyzing negative results in machine learning.",
        "The focus on real-world challenges in Transformer architectures could be impactful if executed properly."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper lacks sufficient technical depth and novelty. The described experiments and findings are not accompanied by detailed theoretical or empirical analysis.",
        "Experimental details are sparse, making it hard to reproduce results or assess the validity of the claims.",
        "There is almost no mention of related work beyond generic references to Transformer success and sensitivity. The paper fails to situate its contributions within the broader literature.",
        "The ablations and insights are vague and lack actionable takeaways. For example, no specific recommendations or systematic analyses of why certain modifications fail are provided.",
        "The conclusions are superficial and do not advance the understanding of Transformer design or robustness.",
        "Figures and empirical results are minimal and uninformative. The paper relies heavily on broad claims without substantive evidence."
