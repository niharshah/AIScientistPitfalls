    "Summary": "The paper investigates challenges in deploying neural classification models in real-world, multi-factor scenarios. It highlights pitfalls such as data imbalance, instability, and hyperparameter sensitivity, but fails to provide novel contributions or actionable insights. The findings are anecdotal, and the methodology lacks rigor.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The topic is relevant to practical applications of machine learning.",
        "The paper touches on important issues such as data imbalance, instability, and hyperparameter sensitivity, which are widely encountered in real-world scenarios."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper lacks novelty and does not propose actionable or novel solutions to the identified challenges.",
        "The methodology is vague and poorly executed. Figures and results are not well-explained or convincing.",
        "The writing is unclear, with missing references ('**?**') and insufficient detail on experimental setup and outcomes.",
        "The significance of the work is low, as it does not advance the state of the art or provide meaningful insights for practitioners or researchers.",
        "The related work section is incomplete and fails to position the paper within the broader context of existing literature."
