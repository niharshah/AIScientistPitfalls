        "Img_description": "The figure appears to be blank or incomplete, with no discernible plots, axes, labels, or graphical elements.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is either missing or improperly rendered, making it impossible to evaluate its quality or alignment with the caption and main text. Authors should ensure that the figure is correctly generated and presented with labeled axes, legends, and sufficient resolution.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption describes the intended content of the figure but does not align with the blank image provided. While it is concise, it cannot be verified due to the absence of visible data.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references provide context about the figure, describing baseline performance and volatility. However, without the figure's content, these claims cannot be substantiated. Authors should confirm that the figure supports the text references and ensure proper figure inclusion."

    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The figure is divided into two subplots. The left subplot is meant to show loss/MCC trends, while the right subplot is intended for a confusion matrix. Both subplots are entirely blank, with no data, axes, labels, or additional visual elements present.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is incomplete and lacks any meaningful content. There are no curves, data points, or visual indicators to interpret. Axes and labels are also missing, preventing any useful analysis. The figure should be populated with the intended data and include proper labeling and legends to make it interpretable.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption describes loss/MCC trends and confusion matrix details, which are not present in the figure. While concise, the caption does not accurately reflect the figure's contents and should be revised once the figure is completed.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references Figure 2 as an important illustration of the research model's performance and misclassification behavior, but the figure does not support these claims due to its blank state. The references need to be aligned with the updated and populated figure for clarity."
