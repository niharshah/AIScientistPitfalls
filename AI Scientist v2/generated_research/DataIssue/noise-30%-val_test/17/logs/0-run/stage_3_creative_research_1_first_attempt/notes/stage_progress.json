  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Consistent Data Handling**: Successful experiments ensured that data handling was consistent, with correct paths and formats for datasets. This included proper tokenization, padding, and attention masking, which are crucial for models like Transformers.\n\n- **Model Architecture**: Transitioning from GRU-based models to lightweight Transformer encoders proved beneficial. Transformers were able to capture long-range dependencies and symbolic interactions more effectively, leading to improved performance metrics.\n\n- **Metric Tracking and Early Stopping**: Implementing early stopping based on validation metrics like MCC and macro-F1 helped prevent overfitting. Consistent logging of metrics such as training/validation loss, MCC, and macro-F1 scores allowed for thorough analysis and comparison.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Small grid searches over learning rates and epoch budgets were effective in optimizing model performance within the constraints of a 30-minute runtime.\n\n- **Handling Class Imbalance**: Using `pos_weight` in `BCEWithLogitsLoss` helped address class imbalance issues, leading to more stable training and improved robustness.\n\n- **Efficient Resource Management**: Adhering to strict GPU/CPU handling rules ensured that experiments ran efficiently and within the allotted time, facilitating reproducibility and scalability.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **File Handling Errors**: A common failure was the FileNotFoundError due to incorrect dataset paths. Ensuring that dataset files are correctly placed and paths are accurately specified is crucial.\n\n- **Attribute Initialization**: Failing to initialize attributes, such as the 'patience' attribute in the 'EarlyStop' class, led to AttributeErrors. Proper initialization of all class attributes is necessary to avoid such issues.\n\n- **Overly Complex Models**: While augmenting models with additional features like symbolic-rule features can be beneficial, it can also introduce complexity that may not always translate to performance gains, especially if not well-integrated.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Robust Data Path Management**: Implement checks to verify the presence and correctness of dataset paths before execution. Consider using environment variables or configuration files to manage paths dynamically.\n\n- **Comprehensive Attribute Initialization**: Ensure all class attributes are initialized in the constructor to prevent runtime errors. Conduct thorough code reviews to catch such issues early.\n\n- **Balanced Model Complexity**: While exploring hybrid models that combine Transformers with symbolic features, ensure that the added complexity is justified by performance gains. Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of each component.\n\n- **Continued Use of Transformers**: Given their success, continue leveraging lightweight Transformer architectures, possibly exploring deeper models or more heads if computational resources allow.\n\n- **Enhanced Metric Tracking**: Maintain detailed logs of all metrics and losses for each epoch. This data is invaluable for post-experiment analysis and understanding model behavior over time.\n\n- **Regular Hyperparameter Tuning**: Keep hyperparameter tuning as a regular part of the experimental process, especially when introducing new model components or datasets.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, future experiments can build on past successes while avoiding common pitfalls, leading to more robust and effective models."
