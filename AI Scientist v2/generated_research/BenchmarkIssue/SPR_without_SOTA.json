        "Related Work": "Recent work in symbolic reasoning has largely focused on neural-symbolic hybrid methods, such as Neuro-Symbolic Concept Learner (NSCL) and differentiable ILP. However, these methods may not be well-suited for discovering poly-factor rules in SPR. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been applied to various combinatorial optimization problems but are less explored in the context of symbolic rule discovery for classification tasks. Traditional rule-based systems like decision trees and random forests are commonly used but often lack the ability to discover complex poly-factor rules without manual feature engineering. Our proposal distinguishes itself by leveraging the strengths of evolutionary algorithms to automatically discover and optimize complex rule sets for SPR, which can potentially outperform existing methods.",
        "Abstract": "Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) presents a novel challenge of classifying symbolic sequences based on hidden, complex logical rules. Traditional machine learning methods may struggle with the poly-factor nature of these rules. We propose an innovative approach using evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to discover and optimize rule sets for SPR tasks. Unlike neural-symbolic hybrid models or traditional rule-based systems, EAs offer a flexible, adaptive method for evolving solutions without manual feature engineering. We will benchmark our EA-based approach on four selected SPR datasets from HuggingFace, comparing our results against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our hypothesis is that EAs can more effectively capture the intricate logical structures governing SPR, leading to improved classification accuracy and generalization across different benchmarks. This research could significantly impact automated reasoning systems in various domains, including finance, scientific discovery, and academic publishing.",

        "Abstract": "The Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) task involves classifying symbolic sequences based on hidden poly-factor logical rules. Traditional deep learning models, while effective, often operate as black-boxes, providing little insight into their decision-making processes. This lack of interpretability hinders our understanding of the underlying logical structures and limits the model's utility in domains where transparency is crucial. We propose to integrate Explainable AI (XAI) techniques into the training process of deep learning models for SPR. By leveraging methods such as SHAP and LIME, we aim to make the models' predictions more interpretable, allowing us to uncover the hidden logical rules that govern the classification decisions. Our approach will involve training models on symbolic sequences, applying XAI techniques to interpret the model's predictions, and using these interpretations to refine the model. We will evaluate our approach on a subset of SPR benchmarks, comparing the performance and interpretability of our models against state-of-the-art baselines.",

Traditional interpretability methods primarily focus on visualizing input features or attention maps. We propose a novel approach that leverages mnemonic-like symbolic memory patterns to enhance the interpretability of neural models. Our approach involves creating a synthetic dataset where sequences of symbols follow specific mnemonic patterns, similar to how humans use mnemonic devices for memory enhancement. We train neural networks on this dataset and analyze how well they can learn and utilize these mnemonic patterns for decision-making. By mapping the learned representations back to the mnemonic patterns, we aim to gain deeper insights into the model's internal processes and improve its interpretability. We conduct experiments on various symbolic reasoning benchmarks to validate our approach, comparing it against state-of-the-art interpretability techniques. Our findings suggest that mnemonic patterns can serve as a powerful tool for enhancing model comprehension and transparency.",

The SPR task involves classifying symbolic sequences based on hidden poly-factor rules, which encapsulate logical structures derived from shape-count, color-position, parity, and order conditions. Our hypothesis is that a hierarchical attention mechanism, which mimics the human ability to focus on different levels of abstraction, can enhance the model's ability to recognize and generalize these complex rules. We will develop a novel model architecture that incorporates hierarchical attention layers, designed to independently focus on shape, color, and their positional relationships within the sequence. We will benchmark our model on four selected SPR benchmarks and compare its performance against the current state-of-the-art. We anticipate that our model will demonstrate superior accuracy and generalization capabilities, paving the way for more advanced symbolic reasoning systems.",

We propose a contrastive learning framework tailored to the SPR task, where the objective is to learn robust representations of sequences by contrasting positive pairs (sequences with similar hidden rules) against negative pairs (sequences with different rules). Drawing on successful methodologies from contrastive learning in logical reasoning, we will design and train models on the SPR benchmarks and compare their performance to state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches. Our experiments will involve selecting four diverse benchmarks from the available 20, training the models on the train split, tuning on the dev split, and evaluating on the test split. The primary evaluation metric will be label accuracy. We aim to demonstrate that contrastive learning can provide significant improvements in understanding and classifying symbolic sequences governed by intricate rules, thereby advancing the field of symbolic reasoning and its applications in real-world domains.",

By training a meta-learner on a diverse set of SPR tasks, the model will learn a shared representation of poly-factor rules, enabling it to generalize to unseen benchmarks with minimal fine-tuning. We hypothesize that this approach will outperform existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating robust generalization capabilities. The experiments will involve training the meta-learner on a subset of the available benchmarks and evaluating its performance on the remaining benchmarks. Success will be measured by the model's accuracy on the Test split of each benchmark, compared to the SOTA baselines.",

The SPR task involves classifying symbolic sequences based on hidden generation rules that incorporate shape-count, color-position, parity, and order predicates. We hypothesize that integrating visual features of symbolic sequences with their symbolic representations can provide richer context and improve the model's reasoning capabilities. Our approach involves developing a multimodal neural network that combines a visual model (e.g., CNN) with a symbolic reasoning model (e.g., Transformer). We will evaluate our model on four selected benchmarks from a set of 20 curated benchmarks sourced from HuggingFace. Our experiments will involve training and evaluating the model on each benchmark independently and comparing its performance against state-of-the-art baselines.

By leveraging unlabeled data, SSL methods can learn robust feature representations that capture the underlying structure of the symbolic sequences. We propose a two-phase approach: (1) Pre-training a model using SSL on a large corpus of unlabeled symbolic sequences, and (2) Fine-tuning the pre-trained model on labeled data from the SPR benchmarks. We hypothesize that SSL will enable the model to learn more robust representations, leading to improved performance and generalization across different benchmarks. We will evaluate our approach on four selected benchmarks from the SPR dataset and compare the results with state-of-the-art supervised learning methods.",

We will evaluate our model on four selected benchmarks from the HuggingFace SPR dataset, comparing its performance to existing SOTA results. Our approach will involve training a neural network to learn symbolic representations and rules from data, which will then be combined with predefined symbolic logic rules to enhance reasoning capabilities. We expect this integration to provide both high accuracy and interpretability, addressing the limitations of purely neural or symbolic approaches.",

        "Related Work": "Recent works in hybrid symbolic-neural models have shown promise in tasks requiring both perception and reasoning. For example, Agarwal et al. (2021) developed NSNnet, a neural-symbolic model for image-based reasoning tasks. Lemos et al. (2020) proposed a neural-symbolic graph neural network for relational reasoning on knowledge graphs. Gao et al. (2024) introduced a hybrid neural-logical reasoning approach for visual question answering. These studies highlight the potential of hybrid models in various domains but do not address the specific challenges of the SPR task, which involves complex symbolic sequences and hidden logical rules. Our proposal aims to fill this gap by developing a hybrid model tailored for the SPR task.",
        "Abstract": "The Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) task presents a unique challenge in symbolic pattern recognition, requiring models to classify sequences of abstract symbols based on hidden logical rules. Traditional neural networks excel in learning from data but often lack interpretability, while symbolic AI methods provide clear logical reasoning but struggle with adaptability. This proposal introduces a hybrid symbolic-neural model that leverages the strengths of both approaches to solve the SPR task. The neural component will learn a representation of the symbolic sequences, while the symbolic component will enforce logical constraints and rules. The model will be trained and evaluated on multiple SPR benchmarks, with a focus on achieving high accuracy and interpretability. We hypothesize that this hybrid approach will outperform existing state-of-the-art models on the SPR task, providing a robust solution for complex symbolic reasoning.",

        "Short Hypothesis": "The generalization ability of machine learning models in the SPR task is significantly influenced by the complexity of the underlying poly-factor rules. By varying the complexity of these rules, we can systematically study and understand how different models adapt to and generalize from training data to unseen test data.",
        "Related Work": "Previous work in symbolic reasoning and rule-based learning has primarily focused on either simple rule-based systems or complex, domain-specific applications. Research into symbolic regression and logical rule induction has shown that models can learn and generalize simple rules effectively. However, there is a gap in the literature concerning how models handle varying levels of rule complexity in a controlled synthetic environment. Our proposal aims to fill this gap by leveraging the SPR task, which allows for precise control over rule complexity.",
        "Abstract": "This research aims to explore the generalization capabilities of machine learning models in the context of Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) by systematically varying the complexity of the underlying poly-factor rules. The SPR task involves classifying sequences of abstract symbols according to hidden logical rules. These rules are composed of multiple atomic predicates, including shape-count, color-position, parity, and order conditions. We propose an experimental framework where the complexity of these rules is systematically varied across different benchmarks. Specifically, we will select benchmarks that represent a gradient of rule complexities and evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art models on these benchmarks. Our hypothesis is that as the rule complexity increases, the generalization ability of models will degrade, providing insights into the limitations and strengths of current symbolic reasoning approaches. We will conduct a series of experiments to validate this hypothesis, including training and evaluating models on benchmarks with low, medium, and high rule complexities. The results will help us understand the current capabilities of machine learning models in handling complex symbolic reasoning tasks and identify areas for future research.",

By incorporating these counterfactuals into both the training and evaluation phases, we hypothesize that models can achieve a deeper understanding of the underlying logical rules, leading to improved classification accuracy and enhanced interpretability. We will develop an algorithm to generate counterfactual sequences and integrate them into the SPR pipeline. Our approach will be evaluated across multiple benchmarks, comparing performance against state-of-the-art baselines.
