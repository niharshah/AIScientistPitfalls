Unlike conventional neural-symbolic approaches that often require explicit rule definitions, our approach will use SSL to learn latent representations of sequences, capturing underlying rules without direct supervision. By generating multiple views of each sequence and employing contrastive learning, we hypothesize that our model will uncover and utilize hidden poly-factor rules for classification. We will enhance our approach using meta-path guidance and counterfactual data augmentation to improve robustness and interpretability. Our method will be evaluated on four selected benchmarks from the SPR dataset, comparing its performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Key experiments will involve ablation studies to understand the contribution of different SSL components and the use of interpretable modules to visualize learned rule structures.

We propose leveraging curriculum learning to enhance SPR tasks by gradually increasing the complexity of training examples, enabling the model to build a robust understanding of simpler rules before tackling more complex ones. Our approach involves designing a curriculum that introduces rule complexities in a controlled manner, ensuring a smooth learning progression.

        "Abstract": "Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) tasks involve classifying symbolic sequences based on hidden logical rules that encapsulate complex structures. Traditional machine learning models often struggle with generalization and interpretability due to the complexity of these rules. We propose leveraging cognitive biases to enhance SPR tasks by incorporating human-like heuristics into machine learning models. Cognitive biases, such as representativeness, anchoring, and availability, can help models navigate complex rule-based environments more effectively by mimicking human decision-making processes. Our approach involves designing a model that integrates cognitive biases into its architecture, enabling it to leverage these heuristics during training and inference. We will evaluate our cognitive bias-based model on selected SPR benchmarks, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art baselines. The evaluation will focus on accuracy, generalization, and interpretability, demonstrating the effectiveness of cognitive biases in improving SPR task performance. By enhancing the performance and interpretability of SPR tasks, our research has the potential to impact various domains where understanding symbolic data patterns is crucial, such as finance, academic publishing, and scientific discovery.",

Our approach involves developing a symbolic analysis module that evaluates the complexity of rules and sequences, and a curriculum learning module that adjusts the training data accordingly. We will evaluate our symbolic-driven curriculum learning model on selected SPR benchmarks, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art baselines. The evaluation will focus on accuracy, generalization, interpretability, and computational efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in improving SPR task performance. By enhancing the performance and interpretability of SPR tasks, our research has the potential to impact various domains where understanding symbolic data patterns is crucial, such as finance, academic publishing, and scientific discovery.",

These methods focus on generating counterfactuals that are valid and sparse, but there is still a need for improvement in generating explanations that are both meaningful and interpretable. Approaches like SPARCE and ACTS have shown the importance of sparsity in counterfactual explanations, but they often require complex optimization techniques that can be computationally expensive. Methods like TimeTuner and MASCOTS emphasize the need for interpretability in time series forecasting but do not fully address the generation of counterfactuals that are both sparse and intuitively meaningful.",

However, the black-box nature of these models poses significant challenges in terms of interpretability and trust. This research proposes a novel approach to enhance the interpretability of deep learning models for time series forecasting using sparse and meaningful counterfactual explanations. The central hypothesis is that by generating counterfactual instances that are both sparse and intuitively meaningful, we can gain insights into the model's decision-making process and improve user trust. The study will involve developing a framework for generating such counterfactual explanations tailored to time series data and integrating this framework with popular deep learning models. We will evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using standard time series datasets and compare it with existing interpretability methods. Key metrics will include the fidelity of the counterfactual explanations, their computational efficiency, and their ability to improve human understanding and trust in model predictions.

While these studies provide a foundation, the proposed research distinguishes itself by integrating meta-learning specifically with the SPR task, aiming to enhance generalization across diverse symbolic patterns.",
        "Abstract": "The Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) task presents a unique challenge in machine learning, requiring models to classify symbolic sequences based on hidden logical rules. These rules can vary significantly across benchmarks, making generalization a critical yet challenging aspect. This research proposes leveraging meta-learning to improve the generalization capabilities of models in the SPR task. Specifically, we will explore the use of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to train models that can quickly adapt to new rule sets with minimal training data. By focusing on the meta-learning framework, we aim to develop a robust algorithm that outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks and demonstrates strong generalization across different rule complexities and sequence characteristics. We will evaluate our approach on a selection of SPR benchmarks, comparing its performance to existing methods and analyzing its ability to generalize across diverse symbolic patterns.",

SSL has shown promise in fields like natural language processing and computer vision, where models pre-trained on large, unlabeled datasets can achieve state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on specific tasks. This proposal aims to explore the application of SSL to SPR, a relatively unexplored area. Relevant works include MERIt, which uses meta-path guided contrastive learning for logical reasoning, and GeoDRL, which integrates symbolic logic with deep reinforcement learning for geometry problem solving.",

Traditional supervised learning methods have shown limited success, often requiring large amounts of labeled data and struggling with generalization.

By pre-training models on large, unlabeled datasets of symbolic sequences, we aim to learn robust and transferable representations that can be fine-tuned on specific SPR benchmarks. We hypothesize that SSL can capture underlying patterns and structures within symbolic sequences, leading to improved accuracy and generalization. Our approach will be evaluated on four selected benchmarks from a set of 20, comparing performance against state-of-the-art supervised methods. We will conduct experiments to assess the impact of different SSL strategies, such as contrastive learning and masked token prediction, on SPR performance.

This approach can potentially lead to models that not only learn the latent rules effectively but also generalize better across variations in vocabulary sizes, sequence lengths, and rule complexities.",
        "Related Work": "1. Symbolic Reasoning in Neural Networks: Current approaches in symbolic reasoning often rely on static pattern recognition techniques or rule-based systems, which lack the ability to adapt dynamically to new data or changing patterns. 2. Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Sequential Decision Making: RL has been widely used for tasks that require learning from dynamic environments, but its application to symbolic reasoning remains underexplored. 3. Temporal Dynamics in AI: Recent studies have shown that incorporating temporal aspects into AI models can improve their performance on tasks that involve sequence prediction and pattern recognition.",
        "Abstract": "The Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) task involves classifying symbolic sequences governed by hidden generation rules. These rules are poly-factor, derived from shape-count, color-position, parity, and order conditions. While traditional methods have achieved moderate success on SPR benchmarks, they often struggle with generalization and adaptability. This proposal explores the integration of temporal dynamics into reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks to enhance the performance of models on the SPR task. By treating the symbolic sequences as dynamic environments and leveraging RL's ability to learn from temporal data, we aim to develop a robust algorithm that outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. The proposed approach involves designing an RL agent that interacts with the symbolic sequences, learns the hidden generation rules through trial-and-error, and adapts its strategies based on feedback. Experiments will be conducted on selected SPR benchmarks, and the performance will be evaluated based on accuracy on unseen test data. This research has the potential to advance the field of symbolic reasoning and open new avenues for applying RL to complex reasoning tasks.",

Traditional approaches to SPR focus on a single-task learning (STL) paradigm, where the model is trained to predict a binary label for each sequence based on implicit symbolic rules. We propose an MTL framework that simultaneously learns to predict different types of atomic predicates (Shape-Count, Color-Position, Parity, and Order) in addition to the overall binary label. By explicitly learning these underlying predicates, we hypothesize that the model can better capture the intricate symbolic patterns and improve its generalization performance across various benchmarks. To validate our approach, we will select four benchmarks from the provided dataset, ensuring a diverse representation of rule complexities and sequence characteristics. Our experiments will involve training an MTL model with shared representations and task-specific heads for each atomic predicate type. We will compare the performance of our MTL model against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines on the selected benchmarks, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach.",

Unlike static models, our meta-learning algorithm aims to rapidly adapt to variations in these rules by leveraging meta-learning principles. The proposed approach will be trained on a distribution of synthetic poly-factor rules and will be evaluated on its ability to generalize and adapt to unseen rules. We hypothesize that this dynamic adaptability will enable our model to outperform current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across multiple benchmarks. The algorithm will be benchmarked on four selected datasets from the SPR task, chosen for their diverse rule complexities.

        "Related Work": "Contrastive learning has shown significant success in various domains, especially in visual and textual representations (Chen et al., 2020; He et al., 2020).

Existing work on SPR primarily focuses on traditional supervised learning methods and logical rule induction (e.g., Talmor et al., 2020; Clark et al., 2020). Our proposal distinguishes itself by introducing contrastive learning to the domain of symbolic reasoning, aiming to improve the generalization and robustness of models in detecting hidden, intricate rules in symbolic sequences.

Our approach involves creating positive and negative pairs of sequences based on rule satisfaction and training an encoder network using a contrastive loss function. We evaluate our method on four selected SPR benchmarks from HuggingFace, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art baselines.

Notable methods include magnitude-based pruning and advanced techniques like Lottery Ticket Hypothesis.

This proposal aims to fill this gap by incorporating temporal dynamics into the pruning process, potentially leading to more efficient and effective pruning strategies.",

Traditional pruning methods rely on static criteria, such as weight magnitudes, to determine which neurons or connections to remove. However, these methods often overlook the temporal aspect of neuron activations, which can provide crucial insights into the importance of different network components over time. By analyzing the temporal patterns of neuron activations, we aim to identify and prune neurons that contribute less consistently to the model's performance across training epochs. Our approach involves monitoring neuron activations at regular intervals during training and using this temporal data to guide the pruning process. We hypothesize that incorporating temporal dynamics will lead to more efficient pruning, resulting in smaller models with comparable or even improved performance. We will evaluate our method on standard benchmarks such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, comparing it against state-of-the-art pruning techniques. The expected outcome is a more effective pruning strategy that can be easily integrated into existing training pipelines, making neural networks more efficient and accessible for deployment on resource-constrained devices.",

Recent advances in sequence classification often use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers, but these models typically focus on natural language sequences rather than abstract symbolic sequences. Techniques like SimCLR, ConPoLe, and MoCo have shown great success in visual and textual domains by learning representations through contrastive methods.

        "Abstract": "This proposal aims to develop a novel algorithmic approach using contrastive learning to enhance symbolic rule induction in Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) tasks. SPR involves classifying sequences of abstract symbols based on hidden, complex rules derived from shape, color, and positional attributes. Traditional symbolic reasoning approaches are limited in handling the intricate and latent nature of these rules, especially in the presence of noise and variability in the sequences. By leveraging contrastive learning, we hypothesize that we can create more discriminative and robust feature representations of symbolic sequences, leading to better identification and classification of underlying rules. Our approach will involve designing a contrastive learning framework tailored for symbolic sequences, training it on a subset of SPR benchmarks, and evaluating its performance against existing state-of-the-art methods. The expected outcome is an improved accuracy in rule induction and better generalization across varying sequence lengths and rule complexities.",

Traditional models often struggle with such tasks due to the intricacies of the rules and the variability in symbolic sequences. Our hypothesis is that enabling a model to reflect on its own reasoning process can lead to significant improvements in performance. Specifically, we propose a framework where the model periodically evaluates its own decision-making process, identifies systematic errors, and adjusts its reasoning strategy accordingly. This meta-reasoning framework will be tested on selected benchmarks from the SPR dataset, comparing its performance to state-of-the-art models. Through this approach, we aim to demonstrate that self-reflective learning can enhance the model's ability to generalize across different rule complexities and sequence variations.",

SPR involves classifying sequences of abstract symbols based on hidden poly-factor rules, which are logical structures combining multiple atomic predicates. By employing contrastive learning, we aim to enhance the model's ability to learn meaningful representations of these sequences, improving its performance on the SPR task. We hypothesize that contrastive learning can provide a more robust mechanism for distinguishing between sequences that satisfy the hidden rules and those that do not. Our approach involves creating positive and negative pairs of sequences based on their adherence to the hidden rules and training a model to learn representations that maximize agreement between similar pairs while minimizing agreement between dissimilar pairs. We will evaluate our method on selected benchmarks from the SPR dataset, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art baselines.
