    "Summary": "The paper investigates pitfalls in zero-shot learning and reports negative or inconclusive results from experiments aimed at improving zero-shot generalization. The authors claim to document the fragility of common assumptions in zero-shot setups and provide lessons for researchers to avoid similar pitfalls.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper tackles an underrepresented but important topic: negative results in machine learning, specifically in zero-shot learning.",
        "It emphasizes the need for better transparency and reporting of non-improvements in the community."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The contributions are vague and lack novelty. The paper does not propose any concrete methodology or insights that advance the state of the art in zero-shot learning.",
        "The experiments are poorly detailed and lack rigor. Key information about the experimental setup, baselines, and evaluation metrics is missing or insufficiently described.",
        "The results are inconclusive and do not provide actionable insights for practitioners or researchers.",
        "The clarity of the paper is poor. It is difficult to understand the exact problem setup, methodology, and implications of the results due to missing details and disorganized presentation.",
        "The ablation studies do not add much value, as they are not well-motivated or analyzed in depth.",
        "The paper does not include any discussion of relevant related work in sufficient depth to contextualize its findings."

        "How do the findings compare to existing studies on zero-shot learning pitfalls or domain shift?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not adequately address its own limitations or discuss potential avenues for improvement.",
