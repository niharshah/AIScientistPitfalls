        "Img_description": "The figure is missing; only a small filename ('bined.png') is visible. No visual data or axes are present.",
        "Img_review": "The figure appears to be omitted or improperly rendered. No evaluation of visual elements is possible. Authors should ensure proper embedding of figures in the document and verify rendering before submission.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption describes two subplots ('(a) Training/validation loss curves' and '(b) Test metrics over epochs'), but without the figure, alignment cannot be assessed. It may benefit from a concise takeaway summarizing trends.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure and discusses its intended purpose (to combine baseline figures and illustrate training/test performance). However, without the figure, it is impossible to verify alignment or adequacy."

    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The image is labeled 'ablation_bag_of_embeddingsa.png' but appears completely blank, with no visible content such as plots, graphs, or diagrams.",
        "Img_review": "The figure itself is completely blank and does not convey any information. It is unclear whether this is an error or intentional. To improve, the authors should ensure the figure contains meaningful content, such as a chart or graph illustrating the ablation results. Additionally, the figure should include labeled axes, a legend, and other relevant annotations to clarify the data being presented.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption claims to describe an ablation study showing the impact of removing a 'bag of embeddings,' suggesting slight gains or no change. However, since the figure is blank, the caption cannot be verified or meaningfully critiqued. It is also unclear whether the key takeaway is sufficiently clear. A concise summary of the results (e.g., numerical changes or trends) should be included.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references to the figure are missing, as indicated by '[]'. This prevents adequate contextualization or explanation of the figure's purpose. The authors should include clear references to the figure in the text, explaining its content and relevance to the study."

    "figure_3": {
        "Img_description": "The image is a placeholder that contains only the filename 'ablation_no_symbolic_features.png'. There is no visual data, chart, or meaningful content present for analysis.",
        "Img_review": "The figure lacks any content or visual information. It is a placeholder with no axes, labels, or data. This makes it impossible to evaluate or draw any scientific conclusions. The authors should replace this with a meaningful figure that conveys results of the ablation study.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption suggests the figure should show results of an ablation study focused on the exclusion of symbolic features and their impact on zero-shot targets. However, the image does not provide any information to support this. The caption needs to be aligned with the actual figure once it is updated.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text does not contain any references to the figure, as indicated by the empty reference section. This makes it difficult to contextualize the figure within the paper. References should be added to explain the figure's purpose and relevance to the study."

    "figure_4": {
        "Img_description": "The image appears to be blank except for a small text label reading 'frozen_random_embeddings.png.' No plots, charts, or visualizations are present.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is incomplete or improperly rendered. It does not provide any meaningful data or visualization to support the claim in the caption. To improve, the authors should include a proper ablation study visualization, such as a chart or table, clearly depicting the performance metrics for 'frozen random embeddings.'",
        "Caption_review": "The caption describes an ablation study supposedly showing 'minimal gains observed in select runs,' but the figure provides no visual evidence or data to support this. The caption is concise but lacks utility without a corresponding figure. Consider revising the caption once the appropriate visualization is added.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The references in the main text are completely absent ('[]'), providing no context or explanation for the figure. The authors should include detailed references to explain the purpose, methodology, and findings related to the figure in the text."

        "Img_description": "The image is a placeholder or improperly rendered figure containing the text: 'no_interaction_symbolic.png'. No visual information or data is provided.",
        "Img_review": "The figure does not display any content, data, or visualization, which prevents analysis or meaningful critique. The authors should ensure the correct figure is included in the paper. If the figure is unavailable, this section should either be removed or revised.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption suggests the figure was intended to demonstrate an ablation study on the effect of removing interactions with the symbolic pipeline. However, without the figure, the caption cannot be verified or linked to any meaningful takeaway. It is concise but lacks details that might have been useful in interpreting the intended content.",
        "Figrefs_review": "There are no references in the main text to explain or contextualize the figure. This omission weakens the integration of the figure into the paper. The authors should include proper references to introduce and interpret the figure in the main text."
