  "current_findings": "## Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Baseline Model Design**: The initial light neural-symbolic baseline was effective, providing a solid foundation for further experimentation. The use of a bag-of-token representation and simple linear classifier was efficient and easily extendable.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic hyperparameter sweeps (e.g., number of epochs, learning rate, batch size, embedding dimension, weight decay, dropout rate, label smoothing, and gradient clipping) were crucial in optimizing model performance. Each tuning experiment was well-structured, with results logged and saved for analysis.\n\n- **Evaluation Metrics**: Consistent use of metrics such as Composite Rule-Weighted Accuracy (CRWA), Symbolic Weighted Accuracy (SWA), and Composite Weighted Accuracy (CWA) provided a clear measure of model performance across different configurations.\n\n- **Data Management**: The experiments adhered to a structured approach for data management, ensuring that all results were saved in a standardized format (experiment_data.npy), facilitating easy analysis and comparison.\n\n- **Execution and Logging**: The experiments were executed successfully without bugs, and comprehensive logging ensured that all relevant data was captured for future reference.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Lack of Failed Experiment Data**: The absence of documented failed experiments limits the ability to identify specific pitfalls. It is crucial to document failures as meticulously as successes to understand potential issues.\n\n- **Overfitting Concerns**: While not explicitly mentioned, there is always a risk of overfitting when tuning hyperparameters extensively. Ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data is critical.\n\n- **Complexity vs. Simplicity**: While the baseline model was effective, there is a risk of over-complicating models with too many hyperparameters or architectural changes without clear justification or understanding of their impact.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Document Failures**: Ensure that all experiments, including those that fail, are documented with as much detail as successful ones. This will help in identifying common pitfalls and areas for improvement.\n\n- **Regularization Techniques**: Consider incorporating more regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, especially when experimenting with more complex models or extensive hyperparameter tuning.\n\n- **Incremental Complexity**: When extending the baseline model, introduce complexity incrementally and systematically evaluate the impact of each change. This will help in understanding the contribution of each component to the overall performance.\n\n- **Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation techniques to ensure that the model's performance is robust and not overly dependent on a specific train-test split.\n\n- **Exploration of New Architectures**: While the current baseline is effective, exploring new neural-symbolic architectures or integrating other machine learning paradigms could provide additional insights and performance improvements.\n\n- **Automated Hyperparameter Optimization**: Consider using automated hyperparameter optimization tools to streamline the tuning process and potentially uncover better configurations more efficiently.\n\nBy building on the successes and addressing the gaps identified, future experiments can be more robust, efficient, and insightful."
