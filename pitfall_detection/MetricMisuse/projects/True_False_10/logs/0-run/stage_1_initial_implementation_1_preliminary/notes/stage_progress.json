  "current_findings": "### Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Baseline Simplicity and Robustness**: Successful experiments often start with simple, robust baselines. These baselines typically involve straightforward tokenization, embedding, and classification processes. For example, converting sequences into bag-of-token representations or using embedding-mean-pooling classifiers has proven effective.\n\n- **Consistent Evaluation and Metric Tracking**: Successful experiments consistently track key metrics such as training loss, validation loss, and Composite Rule-Weighted Accuracy (CRWA) across epochs. This allows for clear monitoring of model performance and facilitates comparisons across different experimental setups.\n\n- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implementing fallback mechanisms, such as using a synthetic dataset when the real dataset is unavailable, ensures that the experiments are always runnable. This approach enhances the robustness and reproducibility of the experiments.\n\n- **GPU Utilization**: Moving models and tensors to GPU when available is a common practice in successful experiments, leading to more efficient training processes.\n\n- **Comprehensive Data Handling**: Successful experiments involve thorough data handling, including building vocabularies from training splits, padding sequences for batching, and saving metrics and predictions.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Module Import Errors**: A recurring issue in failed experiments is the ModuleNotFoundError, particularly with the 'SPR' module. This error typically arises from the SPR.py file not being in the Python path or the current working directory.\n\n- **Lack of Robust Error Handling**: Failed experiments often lack mechanisms to handle missing files or incorrect paths, leading to execution failures.\n\n- **Inadequate Environment Configuration**: Ensuring that all necessary files and dependencies are correctly configured in the environment is crucial. Failures often occur due to missing files or incorrect environment settings.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Baseline Complexity Gradually**: Start with simple, robust baselines and gradually introduce more complex neural-symbolic components. This approach allows for clear benchmarking and understanding of the impact of each added complexity.\n\n- **Implement Robust Error Handling**: Ensure that all scripts include error handling for common issues such as missing files or incorrect paths. This can involve checking for file existence and providing clear error messages or fallback options.\n\n- **Ensure Environment Consistency**: Maintain a consistent environment setup by ensuring all necessary files, such as SPR.py, are present in the working directory or included in the PYTHONPATH. Regularly verify that the environment is correctly configured before running experiments.\n\n- **Leverage GPU Resources**: Continue to utilize GPU resources for training to improve efficiency. Ensure that all models and tensors are moved to the GPU when available.\n\n- **Comprehensive Documentation and Saving**: Maintain detailed documentation of each experiment, including design choices, metrics tracked, and results. Save all relevant data, metrics, and models to facilitate future analysis and replication.\n\nBy adhering to these recommendations and learning from both successful and failed experiments, future research can be more efficient, robust, and insightful."
