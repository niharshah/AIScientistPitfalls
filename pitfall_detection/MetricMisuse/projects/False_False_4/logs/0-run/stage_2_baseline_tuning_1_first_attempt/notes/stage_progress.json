  "current_findings": "### Comprehensive Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Baseline Establishment**: The initial minimal neural-symbolic baseline was successful in setting up a clean and reproducible starting point. This involved representing shape-color tokens as discrete symbols and using a simple neural model to predict labels. The setup was efficient, allowing for quick iterations and evaluations.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic hyperparameter tuning, including learning rate, batch size, weight decay, and embedding dimensions, was crucial in optimizing model performance. Each tuning effort involved retraining models from scratch and evaluating them on various metrics, leading to incremental improvements in accuracy and loss.\n\n- **Metric Tracking and Logging**: Consistent logging of metrics such as accuracy, loss, and newly introduced metrics like SWA (Shape-Weighted Accuracy), CWA (Color-Weighted Accuracy), and WGMA (Weighted Geometric Mean Accuracy) provided a comprehensive view of model performance across different dimensions.\n\n- **Correcting Implementation Errors**: Identifying and fixing implementation errors, such as the incorrect loading of datasets and the definition of the generalization mask, led to significant improvements in the Rule Generalization Score (RGS), a critical metric for assessing zero-shot reasoning capabilities.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Zero RGS Issue**: A recurring issue was the model's inability to generalize to unseen tokens, resulting in a zero RGS. This was often due to the lack of mechanisms to handle out-of-vocabulary tokens and the incorrect definition of the generalization mask.\n\n- **Data Loading Errors**: Incorrect data loading practices, such as using keyword arguments instead of a dictionary for `DatasetDict`, led to datasets being improperly split, causing dev/test sets to mirror the training set and skewing results.\n\n- **Serialization Errors**: Attempting to save experiment data containing non-serializable objects like lambda functions led to PicklingErrors. This highlighted the need for careful data structuring and serialization practices.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Generalization Mechanisms**: To improve RGS, incorporate strategies for handling unseen tokens. This could include using pre-trained embeddings, implementing subword tokenization techniques, or adding architectural components like attention mechanisms or external memory modules.\n\n- **Robust Data Handling**: Ensure datasets are loaded and split correctly to prevent data leakage and ensure accurate evaluation. Use explicit dictionary structures for dataset loading and verify splits before proceeding with experiments.\n\n- **Improve Serialization Practices**: Avoid using non-serializable objects in experiment data. Replace lambda functions with standard functions or use serialization methods that support complex objects.\n\n- **Iterative Refinement**: Continue leveraging systematic hyperparameter tuning and metric tracking to iteratively refine models. This approach has proven effective in optimizing model performance and should be maintained.\n\n- **Comprehensive Error Analysis**: Implement thorough error analysis protocols to quickly identify and rectify issues. This includes reviewing logs, debugging errors, and validating assumptions at each step of the experimental process.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations and building on the successes and lessons learned, future experiments can achieve more robust and generalizable results."
