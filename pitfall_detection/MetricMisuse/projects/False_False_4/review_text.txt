    "Summary": "The paper investigates a neural-symbolic pipeline's ability to generalize in zero-shot and out-of-distribution scenarios. It reports that the model fails to extrapolate object-centric rules despite high training accuracy, highlighting pitfalls such as reliance on superficial features (e.g., color cues) and misleading metrics like standard accuracy. The authors argue that these findings underline the need for more robust evaluation protocols.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper tackles a relevant problem in the field: out-of-distribution generalization and robustness in zero-shot settings.",
        "The negative results highlight important pitfalls in over-reliance on superficial metrics and features, which could inform future research."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper does not propose any novel methodologies, frameworks, or solutions to address the identified issues.",
        "Experimental rigor is lacking. The paper only provides limited quantitative analyses and qualitative illustrations, which are insufficient to substantiate the claims.",
        "The scope of the experiments is narrow, and the generalizability of the findings is not well justified.",
        "There is a lack of depth in the technical approach. The paper merely highlights failure cases without adequately dissecting why they occur or how they could be mitigated.",
        "The writing lacks clarity, especially in the methodology and experimental sections, where details about the neural-symbolic pipeline and experimental setup are sparse."

    "Questions": [
        "Can the authors provide more details on the experimental setup, including the architecture of the neural-symbolic pipeline and the specific datasets used?",
        "What steps could be taken to address the identified pitfalls, and why were no solutions proposed in this work?",
        "How generalizable are the findings? Do the identified issues extend to other neural-symbolic or rule-based approaches beyond the tested pipeline?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not address how its findings could inform the design of more robust models or evaluation protocols.",
        "No discussion of potential societal impacts or negative consequences of failing to address the identified pitfalls."
