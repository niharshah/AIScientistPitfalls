    "Summary": "The paper investigates the integration of neural networks and symbolic reasoning frameworks for zero-shot learning in Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR). It evaluates a neural-symbolic model on the SPR BENCH benchmark and highlights significant challenges in generalization to unseen rules. The paper finds that traditional neural-symbolic models fail to generalize and overfit training data, and it discusses possible directions for future research to address these limitations.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The topic of zero-shot learning in symbolic reasoning is relevant and challenging.",
        "The paper emphasizes a critical limitation of current neural-symbolic approaches, namely, the inability to generalize to unseen rules.",
        "The evaluation on a dedicated benchmark (SPR BENCH) is helpful for understanding the challenges of SPR tasks in zero-shot settings."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper lacks methodological novelty. The proposed model (a two-layer MLP combined with symbolic reasoning) is simplistic and does not introduce new ideas or techniques.",
        "The experimental results are poor (e.g., low performance metrics) and do not demonstrate any meaningful advancements or insights into addressing the challenges of zero-shot reasoning.",
        "The paper primarily highlights challenges without providing substantial solutions or contributions to overcoming them.",
        "Key experimental details and results are missing, such as visualizations referenced as 'Figure ??', which undermines the clarity and reproducibility of the work.",
        "The related work and discussion sections are shallow, failing to deeply engage with existing literature or thoroughly analyze the limitations of the proposed approach.",
        "The conclusion is generic, reiterating known issues without proposing concrete or actionable future directions."

    "Questions": [
        "What specific advancements or contributions does the proposed model make compared to existing neural-symbolic approaches?",
        "How does the proposed model address (or fail to address) the compositional and rule-based nature of SPR, beyond highlighting these limitations?",
        "Can the authors provide the missing figures (e.g., Figure ??) and clarify the experimental results in the rebuttal?",
        "What insights can be drawn from the poor performance of the model? Are there any specific patterns or failure cases observed that could guide future improvements?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not provide concrete solutions to the identified challenges of zero-shot reasoning in SPR.",
        "Key details are missing (e.g., figures and implementation details) that hinder reproducibility and clarity."
