  "Experiment_description": "The experiments aimed to establish a robust neural-symbolic baseline that processes Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR) sequences by converting them into symbolic histograms. These histograms are then used as input to a two-layer MLP trained with cross-entropy loss, with the overall goal of evaluating model performance using metrics such as Shape-Weighted Accuracy, Color-Weighted Accuracy, and PolyRule Harmonic Accuracy.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are crucial as they establish a foundational baseline for future experimentation with more advanced neural-symbolic reasoning techniques. The insights on overfitting and class imbalance are significant for advancing the model's ability to generalize across unseen data, which could greatly enhance zero-shot reasoning capabilities in SPR tasks.",
  "Description": "Each experiment involved processing SPR sequences into symbolic histograms, which were then input into a two-layer MLP. The models were trained using cross-entropy loss and evaluated based on key performance metrics. The experiments were designed to be robust and adaptable to various hardware environments, ensuring continuity with synthetic data generation and comprehensive logging and visualization.",
