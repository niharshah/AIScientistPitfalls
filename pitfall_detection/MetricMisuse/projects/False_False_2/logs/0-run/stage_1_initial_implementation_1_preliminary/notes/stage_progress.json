  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Lightweight and Simple Design**: Successful experiments often started with a lightweight neural-symbolic baseline. This approach involved converting sequences into symbolic histograms and using a small 2-layer MLP for classification. The simplicity of the design ensured that the model was easy to implement and debug, leading to successful execution without errors.\n\n- **End-to-End Pipeline**: The successful experiments were characterized by a fully working end-to-end pipeline that included data loading, model training, evaluation, and logging. This comprehensive approach ensured that all components of the experiment worked seamlessly together.\n\n- **Robustness and Flexibility**: The scripts were designed to automatically detect the GPU and fall back on the CPU if necessary. They also fabricated a tiny synthetic dataset when the benchmark was absent, ensuring that the code always ran. This robustness and flexibility contributed to the success of the experiments.\n\n- **Effective Metric Tracking**: Successful experiments tracked multiple metrics, including loss, Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), and PolyRule Harmonic Accuracy (PHA). This comprehensive metric tracking provided a clear picture of the model's performance.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Incorrect Function Usage**: One of the failures was due to a TypeError caused by using an incorrect function for synthetic data generation. The `load_dataset` function was used with an invalid 'data' argument, leading to execution failure.\n\n- **Vocabulary Size Issues**: Another common failure was related to a CUDA error caused by out-of-bounds indices in the embedding layer. This occurred because the vocabulary size was smaller than the indices being passed, highlighting the importance of correctly building the vocabulary.\n\n- **Missing Modules**: A failure occurred due to a ModuleNotFoundError when the 'SPR' module could not be found. This was likely due to the 'SPR.py' file being missing or not properly installed, emphasizing the need for proper module management.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Start Simple and Build Complexity Gradually**: Begin with a simple and lightweight baseline that is easy to implement and debug. Once the baseline is working, gradually introduce more complex neural-symbolic reasoning components.\n\n- **Ensure Robustness and Flexibility**: Design experiments to be robust to different hardware configurations and data availability. Implement fallbacks and synthetic data generation to ensure that the code runs under various conditions.\n\n- **Thoroughly Validate Function Usage**: Before using any function, especially for data loading or processing, validate its compatibility with the intended use case. This will help avoid errors related to incorrect function usage.\n\n- **Carefully Manage Vocabulary**: Ensure that the vocabulary is correctly built and includes all tokens present in the dataset. This will prevent issues related to out-of-bounds indices in embedding layers.\n\n- **Verify Module Availability**: Before running experiments, verify that all necessary modules and files are available and correctly installed. This will prevent errors related to missing modules.\n\n- **Comprehensive Metric Tracking**: Continue to track a comprehensive set of metrics to gain a clear understanding of the model's performance. This will help in identifying areas for improvement and in making informed decisions about model adjustments."
