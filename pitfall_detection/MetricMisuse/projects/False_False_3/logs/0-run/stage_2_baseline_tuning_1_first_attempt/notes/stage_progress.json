  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Baseline Model Design**: The initial baseline model, which treats the task as a plain sequence-classification problem using a Bag-of-Embeddings approach, provides a solid foundation. This model allows for straightforward tracking of metrics such as Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), and Harmonic-Weighted Accuracy (HWA).\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic grid-search over various hyperparameters such as epochs, learning rates, batch sizes, embedding dimensions, weight decay, dropout rates, label smoothing, and max gradient norm has been effective. Each hyperparameter tuning experiment isolates the effect of the parameter, leading to incremental improvements in model performance.\n\n- **Consistent Evaluation Metrics**: The use of consistent evaluation metrics (SWA, CWA, HWA) across experiments allows for easy comparison and tracking of progress. This consistency is crucial for identifying which changes lead to improvements.\n\n- **Data Management and Storage**: Proper storage of experiment data, including metrics, losses, predictions, and ground-truths, in a structured format (e.g., `experiment_data.npy`) ensures that results are reproducible and analyzable.\n\n- **Device Utilization**: Efficient use of available hardware resources (e.g., GPU) ensures faster training and evaluation, which is crucial for iterating quickly over multiple experiments.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Overfitting**: Some experiments, particularly those with longer training epochs or larger models, risk overfitting to the training data. This is evident when validation and test accuracies do not improve or even degrade despite improvements in training accuracy.\n\n- **Inadequate Hyperparameter Ranges**: While grid-search is effective, limited ranges or steps in hyperparameter values might miss optimal settings. For instance, not exploring a wide enough range of learning rates or dropout rates could lead to suboptimal performance.\n\n- **Complexity vs. Performance Trade-offs**: Increasing model complexity (e.g., larger embedding sizes or more layers) does not always translate to better performance and can lead to diminishing returns or even worse results due to overfitting or increased computational costs.\n\n- **Inconsistent Results Across Splits**: Some experiments show improvements in validation metrics but fail to generalize to the test set, indicating potential issues with model robustness or data leakage.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Expand Hyperparameter Search**: Consider more extensive hyperparameter searches, possibly using Bayesian optimization or random search, to explore a broader range of values and combinations.\n\n- **Regularization Techniques**: Implement additional regularization techniques such as early stopping, L1/L2 regularization, or more sophisticated dropout strategies to mitigate overfitting.\n\n- **Cross-Validation**: Incorporate cross-validation to ensure that model improvements are consistent across different data splits and not just specific to a particular train/validation/test split.\n\n- **Model Complexity Management**: Carefully balance model complexity with performance. Start with simpler models and gradually increase complexity only if necessary, ensuring that each addition provides a tangible benefit.\n\n- **Experiment with Hybrid Models**: Explore hybrid models that combine neural and symbolic components, especially for tasks requiring zero-shot generalization. This could leverage the strengths of both approaches.\n\n- **Automated Experiment Tracking**: Use tools like MLflow or Weights & Biases for automated tracking of experiments, hyperparameters, and results, which can streamline the experimentation process and facilitate collaboration.\n\nBy following these insights and recommendations, future experiments can be more efficient, robust, and likely to yield meaningful improvements in model performance."
