        "Img_description": "The image is a placeholder containing only the text 'baseline_loss_and_val_accuracy.png' and does not display any graphical data, axes, curves, or information.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is not presented, only a placeholder is provided. This prevents any analysis of the data, trends, or alignment with the caption. To improve, the actual figure should be included, with clear axis labels, legends, and visual representation of the relevant data.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption describes training curves, validation accuracy, and declining loss, but the figure does not display any of these. The caption is irrelevant given the absence of content in the figure.",
        "Figrefs_review": "No references to the figure are provided in the main text. This omission makes it unclear how the figure is intended to be used, discussed, or integrated into the paper\u2019s arguments. Adding meaningful references would help contextualize the figure."
    },
    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The image appears to be a placeholder or label with the text 'baseline_test_metrics_and_confusion.png' displayed. It does not contain any data, graphs, or visual content related to test metrics or symbolic rules.",
        "Img_review": "The image is entirely blank apart from a textual placeholder. There are no axes, labels, legends, or results displayed. This makes it impossible to evaluate its quality or alignment with the caption. If this is a placeholder, the authors should provide the actual figure. If this is the intended submission, it fails to meet the standards of a scientific figure.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption describes 'Test metrics on unseen symbolic rules' and refers to 'large gaps suggesting overfitting to known configurations.' However, the figure does not contain any content to confirm or refute this description. The caption cannot be assessed against a blank figure.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The references to the figure in the main text are missing, as indicated by []. Without references, the context, purpose, and integration of the figure into the text cannot be evaluated. The authors should provide meaningful figrefs that explain the figure's content and relevance."
    },
    "figure_3": {
        "Img_description": "The figure contains four subplots labeled (a), (b), (c), and (d), each currently serving as placeholders with filenames instead of actual data. The filenames suggest topics such as 'multi-dataset ablation', 'effect of CLS token pooling', 'removing positional embeddings', and 'bag-of-embeddings variant', but no visual or analytical content is provided.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is incomplete, as it contains only filenames in place of actual graphical data. This prevents any meaningful interpretation or analysis and renders the figure ineffective. To improve, the placeholders should be replaced with actual subplots containing clear visualizations, labeled axes, legends, and annotations. Additionally, the figure title or labels should clarify how the subplots relate to the claimed ablation results.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption, 'Ablation results illustrating architectural components affecting zero-shot symbolic generalization', does not align with the figure content. Since the figure lacks visual data, the caption is misleading. Once actual data is included, the caption should be updated to provide a concise summary of the results presented in the figure.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references are missing (`[]`). This omission makes it difficult to understand the figure's purpose or relevance within the paper. To improve, the main text should reference the figure in detail, explaining its content, context, and how it supports the paper's findings."
