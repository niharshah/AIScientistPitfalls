  "current_findings": "### Comprehensive Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n- **Minimalist Baseline Models**: Successful experiments often began with a minimalist neural-symbolic baseline. These models treated each shape-color token as a discrete symbol, embedded it, and used simple architectures like linear classifiers or GRUs. This approach allowed for fast training and effective learning of correlations between symbolic tokens and labels.\n  \n- **Effective Use of Metrics**: Successful experiments consistently tracked a comprehensive set of metrics, including training and validation loss, overall accuracy, Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), and the Novel Rule Generalization Score (NRGS). This thorough evaluation provided insights into various aspects of model performance.\n\n- **Device and Data Handling**: The experiments adhered to device-placement guidelines, ensuring efficient use of available hardware resources. They also implemented fallback mechanisms for missing datasets, using synthetic data to ensure the script always ran.\n\n- **Structured Data Storage**: Metrics, losses, predictions, and ground-truth labels were stored in a structured format and saved for further analysis. This practice facilitated easy access to experimental data for visualization and debugging.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n- **Data Availability Issues**: A recurring issue in failed experiments was the unavailability of the SPR_BENCH dataset. FileNotFoundErrors were common, indicating that the dataset was either missing or not correctly placed in the expected directory.\n\n- **Overfitting**: Some experiments showed a significant drop in performance metrics during the test evaluation phase compared to the validation phase, suggesting overfitting. High validation accuracy did not translate to test accuracy, indicating the model's poor generalization to unseen data.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n- **Ensure Data Accessibility**: Before running experiments, verify the presence and correct placement of all required datasets. Consider implementing checks at the start of the script to confirm data availability and provide clear instructions for setting the correct data paths.\n\n- **Enhance Model Generalization**: To address overfitting, incorporate regularization techniques such as dropout or weight decay. Implement early stopping based on validation performance to prevent excessive training. Increasing the diversity of the training dataset can also improve model generalization.\n\n- **Leverage Minimalist Approaches**: Continue using minimalist neural-symbolic models as a baseline. These models have proven effective in learning symbolic correlations quickly and can serve as a foundation for more complex architectures.\n\n- **Comprehensive Metric Tracking**: Maintain the practice of tracking a wide range of metrics. This approach provides a holistic view of model performance and helps identify specific areas for improvement.\n\n- **Structured Experimentation**: Continue storing experimental data in a structured format. This practice aids in post-experiment analysis and facilitates the identification of patterns across multiple runs.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes and learn from the failures observed in previous trials, leading to more robust and generalizable models."
