  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning and Early Stopping**: The successful experiments often involved careful hyperparameter tuning, particularly with the number of epochs, and employed early stopping based on validation loss. This approach ensured that the model did not overfit and maintained optimal performance on the validation set.\n\n- **Ablation Studies**: Several successful experiments involved ablation studies that isolated specific components of the model, such as removing symbolic features or positional embeddings. These studies provided insights into the contributions of each component to overall performance.\n\n- **Multi-Dataset Generalization**: Using a combination of biased variants of datasets for training improved generalization, as seen in the Multi-Dataset Generalisation experiment. This approach helped the model perform well on unseen data by exposing it to diverse training examples.\n\n- **Consistent Logging and Evaluation**: Successful experiments maintained rigorous logging of metrics and artifacts, ensuring that results were reproducible and could be easily compared across different experimental setups.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Overfitting**: A recurring issue in failed experiments was overfitting, where models performed well on validation data but poorly on test data. This was often due to insufficient regularization or lack of diversity in training data.\n\n- **Implementation Errors**: Some failures were due to coding errors, such as incorrect variable usage in dictionary comprehensions. These errors can be avoided with thorough code reviews and testing.\n\n- **Lack of Generalization**: Experiments like the Color-Blind Transformer showed poor generalization to test data, indicating that models were not robust to variations not seen during training.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Regularization**: To combat overfitting, implement stronger regularization techniques such as increased dropout rates, weight decay, and early stopping based on test set performance.\n\n- **Diversify Training Data**: Increase the diversity of training datasets through data augmentation or by incorporating additional datasets. This will help models generalize better to unseen data.\n\n- **Thorough Code Validation**: Implement rigorous code validation processes to catch implementation errors early. This includes unit testing and peer code reviews.\n\n- **Experiment with Fusion Techniques**: Explore different fusion techniques carefully, ensuring that any new methods are correctly implemented and tested for performance improvements.\n\n- **Monitor and Analyze Overfitting**: Regularly monitor the gap between validation and test performance to identify overfitting early. Adjust training strategies accordingly, such as by revisiting data splits to ensure no data leakage.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes and learn from the failures to achieve more robust and generalizable models."
