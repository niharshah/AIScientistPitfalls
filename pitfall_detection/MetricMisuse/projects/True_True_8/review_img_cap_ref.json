    "figure_1": {
        "Img_description": "The figure consists of two side-by-side graphs, purportedly showing training curves for contrastive loss (left) and fine-tuning cross-entropy loss (right). However, both graphs are completely blank, with no data, curves, axes, or annotations.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is entirely empty, lacking essential elements such as labeled axes, data points, or legends. This makes it impossible to analyze or draw any conclusions. Improvements needed include adding proper axis labels, plotting data, and including legends to clarify the information presented.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption describes training curves with 'partial improvements followed by plateaus,' hinting at 'representational bottlenecks.' However, the figure contains no visible data or curves to support these claims. The caption is concise, but it does not align with or describe the figure accurately. It should be revised once the figure is updated to include meaningful data.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text does not contain any references to this figure ([ ]), leaving its context and relevance to the research unclear. Proper figrefs should be added to explain the figure's purpose and connect it to the paper's findings."
    },
    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The figure consists of three subfigures arranged side by side. No visible data, axes labels, legends, or annotations are present in the figure, making it impossible to discern specific content or trends.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is incomplete and lacks essential elements such as axes labels, legends, and visible data points or trends. This makes it impossible to assess the performance degradation trends claimed in the caption. Improvements needed include adding labeled axes, meaningful data representation, and clear legends to convey ablation results effectively.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption claims that the figure shows ablation results where removing the projector, pretraining, or freezing the encoder degrades performance. While concise, the caption is uninformative given the lack of data in the figure. It needs to align with a meaningful figure to be useful.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The figrefs provide detailed context regarding the ablation experiments and expected findings. However, they are undermined by the incomplete figure, which fails to visually support the claims. The figrefs could benefit from alignment with a properly constructed figure that matches the experimental outcomes discussed in the text."

    "figure_3": {
        "Img_description": "The image consists of three empty panels or plots. There are no axis labels, legends, titles, or data shown in any of the panels.",
        "Img_review": "The figure lacks any content, including data, axis labels, legends, or annotations. This makes it impossible to interpret or derive any insights. To improve, the figure should include relevant data, axis labels, and a legend to clarify its purpose.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption, 'Additional metrics and baseline comparisons,' does not align with the empty figure. It also lacks specificity and does not summarize the figure's intended takeaways. The caption should be revised to reflect the figure's content and purpose accurately.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references to the figure are empty. There is no explanation or context provided to describe the figure's content, purpose, or conclusions. The figure should be referenced in the text with a clear explanation of its significance."
