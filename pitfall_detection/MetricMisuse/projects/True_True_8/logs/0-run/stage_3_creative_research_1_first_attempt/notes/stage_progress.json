  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Avoiding Name Collisions**: Successful experiments avoided name collisions by clearly distinguishing between different classes with similar names, such as using `TorchDataset` and `HFDataset`.\n\n- **Contrastive Pre-training**: Many successful experiments utilized a SimCLR-style contrastive pre-training step to learn context-aware embeddings. This approach involved creating augmented views of sequences and using a contrastive loss to enforce learning.\n\n- **Efficient Use of Resources**: Successful experiments were designed to respect computational constraints, such as a 30-minute runtime limit, by using lightweight models and efficient data handling techniques.\n\n- **Comprehensive Metric Tracking**: Successful experiments consistently tracked and logged various metrics, including Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), and Composite Weighted Accuracy (CoWA). This comprehensive tracking allowed for clear evaluation of model performance over time.\n\n- **Error Handling and Debugging**: Successful experiments included robust error handling and debugging strategies, such as fixing matrix dimension mismatches and ensuring all tensors were correctly moved to the appropriate device (GPU/CPU).\n\n- **Self-contained and Flexible Scripts**: The experiments were designed to be self-contained, with fallback mechanisms like synthetic datasets in case of missing data, ensuring that the experiments could run smoothly under various conditions.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Matrix Dimension Mismatches**: A common failure was due to mismatches in matrix dimensions, particularly during forward passes. This often occurred when the output dimensions of layers did not match the expected input dimensions of subsequent layers.\n\n- **Undefined Variables**: Some experiments failed due to the use of undefined variables, leading to NameErrors. This highlights the importance of ensuring all variables are properly defined and used.\n\n- **CUDA Device-side Errors**: RuntimeErrors related to CUDA device-side assertions were encountered, often due to invalid memory access or incorrect tensor operations on the GPU.\n\n- **Inadequate Error Messages**: In some cases, the error messages were not sufficiently informative, making debugging challenging. Setting environment variables like `CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1` was necessary for more accurate traceback.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Ensure Compatibility of Layer Dimensions**: Carefully check and match the dimensions of outputs and inputs between layers to prevent runtime errors related to dimension mismatches.\n\n- **Robust Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling and debugging strategies, such as using environment variables for better error tracebacks and validating tensor operations to prevent CUDA errors.\n\n- **Variable Initialization and Usage**: Ensure all variables are properly initialized and used in the code to avoid NameErrors. Conduct thorough code reviews to catch any undefined variables.\n\n- **Leverage Contrastive Learning**: Continue using contrastive pre-training techniques, as they have shown to be effective in learning context-aware embeddings. Consider exploring more sophisticated augmentations and model architectures to further improve performance.\n\n- **Optimize Resource Utilization**: Design experiments to efficiently utilize computational resources, keeping runtime constraints in mind. Consider subsampling large datasets or using lightweight models to stay within limits.\n\n- **Comprehensive Metric Logging**: Maintain detailed logging of all relevant metrics to facilitate thorough analysis and comparison of model performance across different configurations.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations and learning from both successful and failed experiments, future research can be more robust, efficient, and insightful."
