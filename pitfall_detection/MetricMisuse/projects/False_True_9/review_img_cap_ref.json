    "figure_1": {
        "Img_description": "The figure contains two subplots with placeholder images labeled (a) and (b). Subplot (a) is labeled 'Baseline_HWA_Comparison.png' and described as 'Training curves at various learning rates.' Subplot (b) is labeled 'Baseline_Best_HWA.png' and described as 'Near-perfect final accuracy post-training.' Actual visual data is missing.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is incomplete, as it contains only placeholder images without actual data visualizations. This prevents validation of the caption's claims or detailed analysis. Improvement is critical: replace the placeholders with actual plots, ensure axes are labeled clearly, and include legends where necessary.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption is concise and provides a general summary of the figure's intended content. However, its accuracy and relevance cannot be fully assessed due to the lack of actual data in the figure.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure appropriately and provides context for its intended purpose. However, without the actual figure, it is unclear if the references align with the data or trends."
    },
    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The figure consists of two subplots labeled (a) and (b), both of which contain placeholders instead of actual visualizations. The placeholders are filenames ('Abla_Curves.png' and 'Abla_CD_Generalization_256.png'). Additional text fragments are visible below the placeholders but are incomplete and lack context.",
        "Img_review": "The figure currently fails to provide any meaningful data or visualization. Placeholders instead of actual visualizations make it impossible to evaluate the intended claim. To improve, the placeholders should be replaced with the actual plots, and these plots should include clear axes, legends, and labels.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption states, 'Even when increasing model capacity, performance does not degrade.' This claim is unsupported by the current figure content, as there is no data to substantiate it. If the caption is retained, it should align with the updated figure content.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references describe Figure 2 as showing negligible differences in final accuracy when scaling hidden size, with the model achieving scores above 0.99. These references adequately explain the figure's intended purpose; however, the absence of meaningful figure content prevents validation of these claims. The figure must be updated to fulfill the expectations set by the references."
