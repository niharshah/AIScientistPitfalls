  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Contrastive Pre-training**: Many successful experiments utilized SimCLR-style contrastive pre-training with context-aware augmentations (e.g., token masking, local shuffling). This approach consistently improved the model's ability to capture shape and color dependencies, leading to high Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), and Shape-Color-Weighted Accuracy (SCWA).\n\n- **Transformer Utilization**: Replacing mean-pool encoders with lightweight Transformers equipped with learnable positional encodings significantly boosted performance. The ability to capture token order and long-range dependencies was crucial for achieving high accuracy metrics.\n\n- **Efficient Training and Fine-tuning**: Successful experiments maintained a balance between pre-training and fine-tuning epochs, ensuring that the models were trained efficiently within time constraints. This was achieved by using small model sizes and modest epoch counts.\n\n- **Comprehensive Logging and Saving**: All successful experiments involved meticulous logging of metrics, losses, predictions, and ground-truth labels. This data was consistently saved to a structured format (e.g., NumPy dictionary), facilitating later analysis and visualization.\n\n- **Adherence to GPU/CPU Handling**: Successful experiments ensured that all tensors, models, and optimizers were correctly moved to the appropriate device (GPU or CPU), which contributed to smooth execution without runtime errors.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Improper Multiprocessing Configuration**: A notable failure occurred due to a RuntimeError when CUDA was used in a forked subprocess. This was caused by the DataLoader's worker processes attempting to use CUDA, which is incompatible with the default 'fork' start method for multiprocessing.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Adopt Contrastive Pre-training**: Continue leveraging contrastive pre-training with context-aware augmentations, as it has proven effective in enhancing the model's representation capabilities.\n\n- **Utilize Transformers for Encoding**: Given their success, consider using lightweight Transformers with positional encodings to capture token order and dependencies, especially for tasks involving symbolic sequences.\n\n- **Optimize Multiprocessing Configuration**: To avoid runtime errors related to CUDA and multiprocessing, set the multiprocessing start method to 'spawn' at the beginning of the script using `torch.multiprocessing.set_start_method('spawn', force=True)`.\n\n- **Maintain Efficient Training Schedules**: Balance pre-training and fine-tuning epochs to ensure models are trained effectively within time constraints. Use small model sizes and modest epoch counts to respect time and memory limits.\n\n- **Ensure Comprehensive Logging**: Continue the practice of logging all relevant metrics and saving them in a structured format for easy analysis and visualization. This will aid in understanding model performance and making data-driven improvements.\n\nBy following these recommendations, future experiments can build on past successes while avoiding common pitfalls, ultimately leading to more robust and effective models."
