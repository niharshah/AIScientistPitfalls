        "Img_description": "The figure consists of two placeholders labeled 'baseline_macro_F1.png' and 'baseline_loss_curves.png'. No graphical data or trends are visible in either plot.",
        "Img_review": "The figure lacks any actual content or data visualization, rendering it meaningless for analysis. To improve, the authors must include plots showing the trends of macro-F1 and training loss across epochs. Ensure axes are labeled clearly, legends are provided, and the data is visually distinguishable.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption describes the intended content accurately but is irrelevant due to the absence of actual data in the figure. Once data is added, ensure the caption includes a concise takeaway or observation about the trends.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure assuming it contains meaningful data for macro-F1 and loss curves. However, without actual plots, these references are speculative and unsupported. If the figure is updated, the references should include specific observations or insights derived from the trends. Otherwise, references to this figure should be removed."

    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The image is divided into two blank sections, presumably placeholders for validation metrics (left) and a confusion matrix (right). However, no data, plots, or numerical information is visible.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is incomplete and provides no usable data or insights. It appears to be a placeholder rather than the intended visualization. To improve, ensure the figure is fully rendered with appropriate data, labels, and legends.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption claims the figure includes validation metrics and a confusion matrix, but the actual image does not contain these elements. The caption does not align with the content and should be revised once the figure is complete.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure to discuss validation metrics, macro-F1 scores, and the confusion matrix's insights into classification errors. However, without a complete figure, these references cannot be substantiated. The main text appears to rely on a figure that does not currently support its claims."
