# Dynamic Rule Learning and Meta-Learning Ensemble for Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR)

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our research on tackling the Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR) task using a novel approach that integrates dynamic rule learning with a meta-learning ensemble framework. This repository contains the source code, datasets, and experimental results presented in our paper.

## Overview

Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR) involves identifying whether sequences adhere to hidden rules. Our work addresses the challenge of recognizing these complex symbolic sequences using a hybrid model architecture that combines:

- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** To effectively capture topological relationships in sequences.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** For dynamically learning and adapting generation rules.
- **Meta-Learning Ensemble Framework:** To intelligently combine outputs from specialized model components.
- **Visual Embeddings:** To enhance interpretability and sequence analysis.

Our approach demonstrates improvements in accuracy, precision, and robustness compared to existing state-of-the-art methodologies.

## Key Contributions

1. **Dynamic Rule Learning**: Utilizes GNNs and reinforcement learning to autonomously detect and reformulate hidden rules mirroring human cognitive learning processes.
2. **Meta-Learning Ensemble Framework**: Combines outputs from predicates like Shape-Count and Color-Position for decision-making using a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) strategy.
3. **Synthetic SPR Dataset**: Features sequences of diverse lengths and complexities designed to test poly-factor rule adherence.
4. **Comprehensive Experimental Validation**: Demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach against state-of-the-art benchmarks.
