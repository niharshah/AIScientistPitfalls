# Symbolic Pattern Recognition using Advanced Neural Networks

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation and research findings on a novel hybrid model for Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR). Our approach combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformer-based attention mechanisms, augmented by a neuro-symbolic reasoning layer. The model is designed to tackle the unique challenges posed by SPR tasks, which involve identifying and classifying patterns within sequences governed by hidden poly-factor generation rules.

## Abstract
SPR involves complex pattern recognition tasks governed by intricate rules that are not easily discernible. Our hybrid model integrates GNNs for structural information capture, Transformers for handling sequential dependencies, and a neuro-symbolic reasoning layer to leverage logical predicates such as Shape-Count, Color-Position, Parity, and Order. This approach aims to enhance model robustness, interpretability, and logical consistency.

## Repository Structure

- `datasets/`: Contains scripts for synthetic dataset generation to test various predicate complexities.
- `models/`: Implementation of the GNN, Transformer, and neuro-symbolic reasoning components.
- `experiments/`: Contains experimental setup scripts and configurations.
- `results/`: Includes test results, analysis, and performance metrics of the model.
- `docs/`: Documentation and related papers for deeper insights into SPR methodologies.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/symbolic-pattern-recognition.git
cd symbolic-pattern-recognition
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Dataset Generation**:
   Generate synthetic datasets using the script in `datasets/`. The datasets are designed with a variety of symbolic attributes.

2. **Model Training**:
   Train the model using training scripts in the `models/` directory. Configure hyperparameters as needed based on the setup guide.

3. **Evaluation**:
   Evaluate model performance using the `experiments/` scripts. Compare against state-of-the-art benchmarks included in the `results/`.

## Experimental Setup

- Datasets: Consist of symbolic sequences with attributes of shape, color, position, and order. Designed to challenge the model's generalization capabilities.
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy and logical consistency are key metrics used to assess model performance.
- Framework: The implementation uses PyTorch for leveraging dynamic graph computation.

## Results

Our model achieved a test accuracy of 50.60%, which falls short of the 70.00% baseline set by current state-of-the-art approaches. Detailed results and analysis can be found in the `results/` directory.

## Future Work

Efforts will focus on:
- Enhancing symbolic embeddings
- Implementing advanced dataset augmentation strategies
- Refining neuro-symbolic reasoning capabilities for greater interpretability and accuracy
