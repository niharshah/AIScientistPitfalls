# Symbolic Pattern Recognition using Advanced Graph-Based and Attention Methodologies

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a symbolic pattern recognition (SPR) model leveraging advanced methodologies, including Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and attention mechanisms. Our model aims to determine whether sequences of abstract symbols satisfy hidden target rules, addressing the intricate pattern recognition needs of modern applications across various domains such as linguistics, bioinformatics, artificial intelligence, and data mining.

## Key Features

- Utilizes Graph Convolutional Networks for relational feature extraction from symbol sequences.
- Incorporates attention mechanisms to focus on crucial sequence elements.
- Employs LSTM networks to maintain context and sequence-level dependencies.
- Designed to work on datasets with varying complexities and rule structures.
