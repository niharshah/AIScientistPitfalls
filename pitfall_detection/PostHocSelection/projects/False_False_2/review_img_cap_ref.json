        "Img_description": "The image is a placeholder containing only the text 'baseline_test_confusion_matrix.png' without any actual data or graphical representation of a confusion matrix.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is missing. Without the actual confusion matrix, it is impossible to evaluate the content or its alignment with the caption. Suggestions: include the actual confusion matrix with clear axes, numerical values, and visual elements (e.g., a heatmap) to represent misclassifications effectively.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption describes a confusion matrix and notes that misclassifications are widespread, indicating poor generalization. While the caption is concise and includes a takeaway, it cannot currently be assessed for accuracy since the figure is missing. If the confusion matrix is added, the caption could benefit from explicitly mentioning key observations, such as specific areas of high misclassification.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The references in the main text emphasize that the confusion matrix shows significant misclassifications and poor generalization, aligning with the caption. However, without the actual figure, the adequacy of these references cannot be fully determined. Once the figure is added, ensure that the text references specific features or patterns in the matrix to substantiate claims."
    },
    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The figure contains three subplots illustrating the results of experiments using a joint-token representation. The left subplot shows training and validation loss over epochs, with training loss decreasing monotonically and validation loss remaining high. The middle subplot shows training and validation PMI over epochs, with training PMI increasing steadily and validation PMI remaining low. The right subplot presents a bar chart comparing performance metrics across categories labeled 'CMI,' 'PMI,' and another partially visible label, with scores being relatively low.",
        "Img_review": "The figure effectively demonstrates overfitting and poor generalization caused by the joint-token representation. However, the rightmost plot's purpose is unclear without further explanation or context. The legends for the line plots could be more explicit, and the bar chart would benefit from clearer labeling of the categories.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption aligns with the figure's overall trend, accurately stating that the joint-token representation does not enhance generalization and leads to overfitting. However, it could be more precise by mentioning the training-validation discrepancies explicitly shown in the subplots.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text provides a sufficient high-level explanation of the figure's purpose but does not describe the individual subplots or their implications in detail. The rightmost subplot, in particular, is not adequately explained, leaving ambiguity about its purpose."
    },
    "figure_3": {
        "Img_description": "The figure contains two plots illustrating training and validation metrics over epochs without early stopping. The left plot shows loss curves where training loss decreases while validation loss increases, indicating overfitting. The right plot shows PHA curves where training PHA increases while validation PHA decreases after an initial plateau.",
        "Img_review": "The figure effectively shows the phenomenon of overfitting. However, it could be improved by adding a legend to clarify the color mappings, providing units or definitions for the y-axis labels, and making the titles more descriptive to highlight the overfitting phenomenon explicitly.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption accurately describes the left plot (loss curves) but does not mention the trends in the right plot (PHA curves). It could be extended to provide a more comprehensive summary of the figure's content.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text reference aligns well with the left plot but does not mention the right plot. While it provides useful context regarding overfitting, it misses the opportunity to explain the trends in the PHA metric."
    },
    "figure_4": {
        "Img_description": "The figure contains three subplots: (1) A line plot labeled 'Remove Color Features: Loss Curve,' with x-axis as 'Epoch' and y-axis as 'Loss,' showing training and validation loss trends; (2) A line plot labeled 'Remove Color Features: PCA Curve,' with x-axis as 'Epoch' and y-axis representing a PCA-related metric, displaying train and validation PCA trends; (3) A bar chart labeled 'Remove Color Features: Test Metrics,' showing performance metrics for 'Skills,' 'Color,' and 'Shape.'",
        "Img_review": "The figure is moderately clear but could be improved. Subplots 1 and 2 lack legends, making it ambiguous which curve represents training vs. validation. Subplot 2's y-axis label is unclear and lacks context for the PCA metric. The bar chart (subplot 3) is simple but would benefit from error bars or additional annotations. Consistent color schemes across all plots could enhance visual coherence.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption is partially accurate but overly general. It does not explicitly reference the bar chart, which directly supports the claim about color and shape information. It also overstates the conclusion without fully addressing the loss and PCA curves. The caption could be improved by specifying which subplot supports the claim and providing a concise, evidence-based summary.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references for this figure are missing. This omission makes it difficult to understand how the figure fits into the overall narrative or supports specific claims. Adding detailed figrefs that explain the role of each subplot would significantly enhance clarity and reader comprehension."
    },
    "figure_5": {
        "Img_description": "The figure comprises four subplots: (1) a loss curve showing training and validation loss over epochs, (2) a PHA curve indicating a divergence between training and validation performance over epochs, (3) a bar chart comparing evaluation metrics (SWA, CWA, PHA), and (4) a confusion matrix visualizing the model's classification performance.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is informative and well-organized, with clear labels and legends. However, it lacks explanations for metrics like SWA, CWA, and PHA, making it harder for readers to interpret the results. Additionally, the confusion matrix could be more effectively annotated to highlight key trends or misclassifications.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption is somewhat accurate but overly brief. It mentions the lack of generalization and overfitting but does not directly address the specific observations from the figure, such as the divergence in metrics or the confusion matrix trends. Expanding the caption to include these insights would improve clarity.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references are missing (indicated as []). This significantly detracts from the paper, as the figure is not contextualized within the narrative. Proper references with detailed explanations of the figure\u2019s relevance and findings are necessary."
