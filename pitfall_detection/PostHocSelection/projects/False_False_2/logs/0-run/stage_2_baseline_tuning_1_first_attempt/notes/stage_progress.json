  "current_findings": "## Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Baseline Model and Metrics**: The initial lightweight neural-symbolic baseline model, which converts sequences into symbolic histograms and utilizes a 2-layer MLP, provided a solid foundation. This setup consistently executed without errors and produced reliable metrics, such as PHA, SWA, and CWA, which were crucial for evaluating model performance.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic hyperparameter tuning, including epochs, learning rate, batch size, hidden dimensions, weight decay, dropout rate, activation functions, and optimizer types, was instrumental in improving model performance. Each tuning experiment was well-structured, with clear logging and artifact saving, allowing for easy comparison and analysis.\n\n- **Early Stopping**: Implementing early stopping based on development PHA with a patience window effectively prevented overfitting and ensured that the best model was selected for evaluation.\n\n- **Self-Contained Scripts**: The design of self-contained scripts that automatically handle data loading, synthetic fallbacks, and metric computation ensured that experiments were reproducible and robust to missing data.\n\n- **Consistent Logging and Artifact Management**: All experiments consistently logged metrics, losses, and predictions, and saved them in a structured format. This facilitated easy tracking of progress and comparison across different experimental setups.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Overfitting**: Some experiments, particularly those with larger hidden dimensions or without appropriate regularization (e.g., dropout, weight decay), showed signs of overfitting, as indicated by a significant gap between training and validation/test metrics.\n\n- **Suboptimal Hyperparameter Choices**: In some cases, certain hyperparameter settings, such as very high or low learning rates, led to suboptimal performance. It is crucial to choose a balanced range of hyperparameters for tuning.\n\n- **Inconsistent Improvement**: While hyperparameter tuning generally improved performance, some settings (e.g., certain activation functions or batch sizes) did not lead to significant improvements, highlighting the need for careful selection and evaluation of hyperparameters.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Focus on Regularization**: To mitigate overfitting, future experiments should emphasize regularization techniques, such as dropout and weight decay, especially when experimenting with larger models or datasets.\n\n- **Expand Hyperparameter Search**: Consider expanding the hyperparameter search space, including more diverse settings for learning rates, batch sizes, and optimizer configurations, to identify potentially better-performing configurations.\n\n- **Incorporate Advanced Techniques**: Explore more sophisticated neural-symbolic reasoning methods and architectures, such as attention mechanisms or transformer models, to enhance the baseline model's capabilities.\n\n- **Automate Hyperparameter Optimization**: Implement automated hyperparameter optimization techniques, such as Bayesian optimization or grid search, to systematically explore the hyperparameter space and identify optimal settings.\n\n- **Robust Evaluation**: Ensure robust evaluation by incorporating cross-validation or additional validation datasets to confirm the generalizability of the model's performance across different data splits.\n\n- **Continuous Monitoring and Logging**: Maintain comprehensive logging and monitoring of all experiments, including intermediate results and configurations, to facilitate reproducibility and future analysis.\n\nBy building on the successes and addressing the pitfalls identified in these experiments, future research can achieve more robust and generalizable models."
