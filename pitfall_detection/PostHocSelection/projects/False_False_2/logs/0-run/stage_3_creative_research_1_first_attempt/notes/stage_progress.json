  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hybrid Models**: Successful experiments frequently employed a combination of neural and symbolic components. This hybrid approach allowed models to capture both sequential regularities and rule-critical statistics, leading to improved performance in zero-shot generalization tasks.\n\n- **Early Stopping**: Implementing early stopping based on a specific metric (e.g., Shape-Weighted Accuracy or PHA) was a common strategy that helped prevent overfitting and ensured that the best model was selected for evaluation.\n\n- **Self-Contained Scripts**: Many successful experiments were designed to be self-contained, meaning they could run independently of external datasets by generating synthetic fallback data if necessary. This ensured that experiments could be executed consistently and without interruption.\n\n- **Logging and Artefact Management**: Detailed logging of metrics, losses, and predictions, along with saving artefacts such as loss curves and model checkpoints, was a consistent practice. This facilitated thorough evaluation and comparison of different models and configurations.\n\n- **Symbolic Feature Integration**: Explicitly incorporating symbolic features, such as shape and color variety, either as input features or as training weights, was a key factor in enhancing model performance, particularly in tasks requiring interpretability and rule-based reasoning.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Dimension Mismatch Errors**: A recurring issue in failed experiments was mismatched matrix dimensions during operations such as linear layer transformations. This often occurred when the input dimensionality was not correctly aligned with the expected dimensions of the model components.\n\n- **Handling of Empty Tensors**: Some failures were due to runtime errors involving operations on empty tensors, particularly during loss calculations. This indicates a need for careful handling of tensor operations to ensure that inputs are valid and non-empty.\n\n- **Inadequate Input Preparation**: In some cases, the transformation process in the model's forward method did not correctly handle input dimensionality, leading to errors. Ensuring that all inputs are properly prepared and aligned with model expectations is crucial.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance Dimensionality Checks**: Implement robust checks and validations for input and output dimensions throughout the model pipeline to prevent dimension mismatch errors. This includes ensuring that all transformations and concatenations result in correctly sized tensors.\n\n- **Improve Tensor Handling**: Ensure that all tensors used in operations, especially during loss calculations, are non-empty and of the correct type. Consider adding checks or default values to handle cases where tensors might be empty.\n\n- **Leverage Hybrid Approaches**: Continue to explore and refine hybrid neural-symbolic models, as they have shown promise in capturing both sequential and rule-based patterns. Experiment with different combinations of neural architectures and symbolic features to optimize performance.\n\n- **Focus on Interpretability**: Given the importance of interpretability in certain tasks, maintain a balance between model complexity and transparency. Ensure that symbolic components are informative yet lightweight to aid in understanding model decisions.\n\n- **Optimize Training Procedures**: Experiment with different hyperparameters, such as learning rates and batch sizes, and consider using advanced optimization techniques to further enhance model training and performance.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations and learning from both successful and failed experiments, future research can continue to advance in developing robust and effective models for complex tasks."
