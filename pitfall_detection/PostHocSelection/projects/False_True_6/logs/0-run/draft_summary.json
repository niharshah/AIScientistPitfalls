  "Experiment_description": "The experiments across different nodes explore sequence classification methods for the SPR task. Node 184ca956cf3d4cc99cfeda5a990d5550 uses a neural-symbolic baseline approach, while Nodes 9b9e6880e5b44a73a095908a86e968e4 and 57c4bfbf5b304cb99f20fca8220539e1 employ a GRU-based model.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are crucial in understanding the effectiveness of different sequence classification approaches for the SPR task. They reveal insights into model performance and generalization, highlighting areas like overfitting and the ability to handle unseen rule signatures, which are critical for developing robust models.",
  "Description": "Node 184ca956cf3d4cc99cfeda5a990d5550 uses a neural-symbolic model that embeds discrete symbols and averages them for classification. Nodes 9b9e6880e5b44a73a095908a86e968e4 and 57c4bfbf5b304cb99f20fca8220539e1 utilize GRU models, processing embedded symbols through a GRU and predicting labels with a linear layer. All nodes evaluate using metrics such as accuracy, shape-weighted accuracy, color-weighted accuracy, and NRGS.",
