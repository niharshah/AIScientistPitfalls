    "Summary": "The paper investigates the challenges of zero-shot generalization in symbolic tasks, highlighting the fragile nature of compositional and systematic reasoning in neural networks. It explores several ablations, such as token masking and one-hot representations, to study the impact on zero-shot performance. The findings primarily emphasize the inability of models to generalize under symbolic shifts, with no significant improvements achieved through the tested approaches.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The topic of zero-shot generalization in symbolic tasks is important and relevant for real-world applications.",
        "The paper highlights the brittleness of current neural architectures in symbolic and systematic reasoning tasks."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper lacks novelty as it largely reiterates known issues with zero-shot generalization without offering new or actionable solutions.",
        "The experimental setup is underdeveloped and insufficiently described, with no details on dataset construction, model architecture, or training hyperparameters.",
        "The results are mostly negative and inconclusive without providing meaningful insights or guidance for future work.",
        "The paper fails to properly cite related work, with placeholders (e.g., '[?]') instead of references, which undermines its credibility.",
        "Key figures (e.g., Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3) are not adequately explained, and the accompanying analysis is superficial.",
        "The writing is unclear and poorly organized, making it difficult to follow the contributions and conclusions.",
        "The methodology lacks rigor and reproducibility, as critical details about the experiments are missing."

        "Given the negative results, what actionable recommendations can be drawn for future research?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not adequately address its own limitations or provide concrete next steps to mitigate the observed failures. For instance, what are potential architectural changes or training strategies that could be explored?",
        "The societal impact of the work is not discussed, though it is unlikely to have significant negative implications given its theoretical nature."
