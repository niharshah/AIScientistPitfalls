  "Experiment_description": "The experiments involve testing various neural models for symbolic generalization using the SPR_BENCH dataset. Each node employs a different neural architecture and training strategy to evaluate test accuracy and RCWA under constrained computational settings.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are significant in exploring efficient neural approaches for symbolic reasoning tasks. They demonstrate the viability of simple architectures for generalization while also highlighting challenges such as overfitting and metric instability. The findings guide future research towards more robust models and data handling strategies.",
  "Description": "The experiments evaluated models using token-level vocabulary mapping and neural networks featuring embedding layers, pooling, and classifiers. They monitored training and validation losses, alongside metrics like RCWA, to assess performance. These setups aimed to establish robust baselines for future enhancements in symbolic generalization tasks.",
