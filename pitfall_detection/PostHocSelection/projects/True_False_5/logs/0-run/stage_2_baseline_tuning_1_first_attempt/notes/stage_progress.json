  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Baseline Model Setup**: The initial setup of a simple neural baseline with a small embedding layer, mean-pooled embeddings, and a linear classifier proved effective. This setup allowed for quick experimentation and testing of various hyperparameters with minimal computational cost.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic tuning of hyperparameters such as epochs, learning rate, batch size, embedding dimension, weight decay, max gradient norm, dropout probability, and optimizer type led to improvements in model performance. Notably, tuning epochs and learning rates showed significant improvements in Rule-Complexity-Weighted Accuracy (RCWA).\n\n- **Early Stopping**: Implementing early stopping with a patience parameter during hyperparameter tuning (e.g., epochs) helped prevent overfitting and reduced unnecessary computation.\n\n- **Experiment Logging and Persistence**: Consistent logging of metrics, losses, predictions, and ground-truth labels in a structured format (e.g., `experiment_data.npy`) facilitated easy analysis and comparison across experiments.\n\n- **Optimizer Choice**: Swapping optimizers (e.g., from Adam to AdamW) while keeping other parameters constant allowed for isolating the effects of specific changes, leading to insights on optimizer efficiency.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Lack of Baseline Comparison**: Some experiments did not clearly compare results against a baseline, making it difficult to assess the impact of changes.\n\n- **Overfitting**: Without proper regularization (e.g., dropout, weight decay), models tended to overfit, as indicated by discrepancies between training and validation metrics.\n\n- **Inadequate Hyperparameter Exploration**: Limited exploration of hyperparameter space can lead to suboptimal performance. For instance, not testing a wide range of learning rates or batch sizes might miss potential improvements.\n\n- **Inconsistent Experimentation**: Variability in experimental setup, such as different data splits or inconsistent logging, can lead to unreliable results and difficulty in reproducing experiments.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Expand Hyperparameter Search**: Consider using automated hyperparameter optimization techniques (e.g., grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization) to explore a broader range of hyperparameters systematically.\n\n- **Regularization Techniques**: Incorporate regularization techniques like dropout and weight decay more consistently to mitigate overfitting, especially in larger models or when using more complex architectures.\n\n- **Baseline Comparisons**: Always include a baseline comparison to evaluate the effectiveness of any modifications or new approaches.\n\n- **Comprehensive Logging**: Maintain comprehensive and consistent logging of all experiments, including configurations, metrics, and any anomalies encountered during training.\n\n- **Experiment Replication**: Ensure experiments are easily replicable by documenting the setup, including random seeds, data splits, and any preprocessing steps.\n\n- **Advanced Model Architectures**: Explore more advanced model architectures or ensemble methods if the current baseline reaches a performance plateau.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, future experiments can build on past successes while avoiding common pitfalls, leading to more robust and insightful results."
