  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Transformer Architecture**: The use of a lightweight transformer with learnable positional encodings has proven effective in capturing token order and long-range dependencies, which are crucial for the task at hand. This design consistently achieved high validation accuracies and low losses.\n\n- **Contrastive Pre-training**: Incorporating a contrastive pre-training phase with stochastic, context-aware augmentations (token-masking and local shuffle/reversal) has been beneficial. This approach helps in building robust representations that improve downstream classification performance.\n\n- **Mean-Pooling Strategy**: The mean-pooling strategy for representation, as opposed to using a [CLS] token, resulted in better performance metrics, indicating its effectiveness in capturing sequence-level information.\n\n- **Supervised Fine-tuning**: Fine-tuning with a fresh classification head after pre-training has shown to be effective, particularly when combined with cross-entropy loss and careful monitoring of metrics such as Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), and Shape+Color-Weighted Accuracy (SCWA).\n\n- **Self-contained Scripts**: The use of self-contained scripts that handle data processing, training, evaluation, and logging efficiently has ensured reproducibility and ease of experimentation.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Omission of Positional Embeddings**: Removing positional embeddings led to a noticeable drop in performance, highlighting their importance in sequence modeling tasks.\n\n- **No Contrastive Pre-training**: Bypassing the contrastive pre-training phase resulted in lower performance, suggesting that this step is crucial for learning effective representations.\n\n- **Frozen Encoder**: Freezing the encoder during fine-tuning (linear-probe evaluation) significantly reduced performance, indicating that fine-tuning the entire model is necessary for optimal results.\n\n- **No-View-Augmentation**: Not applying token-level augmentations during contrastive pre-training led to decreased performance, emphasizing the importance of these augmentations in creating robust representations.\n\n- **Attention-Only Encoder**: Removing feed-forward layers from the transformer (attention-only encoder) resulted in reduced model capacity and performance, underscoring the importance of these layers in the architecture.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Maintain Positional Embeddings**: Continue using learnable positional embeddings in transformer models to capture essential sequence information.\n\n- **Incorporate Contrastive Pre-training**: Ensure that contrastive pre-training with appropriate augmentations is part of the pipeline to enhance representation learning.\n\n- **Optimize Fine-tuning Strategies**: Focus on fine-tuning the entire model rather than freezing parts of it, as this approach has consistently yielded better results.\n\n- **Experiment with Augmentations**: Explore different types of augmentations during contrastive pre-training to further improve model robustness and performance.\n\n- **Evaluate Different Architectures**: While the current transformer architecture is effective, exploring variations such as deeper models or different attention mechanisms could provide additional insights and improvements.\n\n- **Ensure Reproducibility**: Continue using self-contained scripts that facilitate easy replication and modification of experiments, ensuring consistent and reliable results.\n\nBy adhering to these recommendations and learning from both successful and failed experiments, future research can build on the current progress to achieve even better performance and insights."
