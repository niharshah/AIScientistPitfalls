  "Experiment_description": "The experiments focus on testing different supervised learning pipelines for processing symbolic token sequences on the SPR_BENCH dataset. Node d7ac6bdce5f04c6582e435c789d604b6 uses an Embedding + GRU model, while nodes 66e67345d9a8412a9cfbac8c0c044a67, 2c8c226ca6f64bc0964989d8bef1a88f, and cfd7fc617253463b9f48242d1bd2102e use mean-pooling and linear classification.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are significant because they provide insights into model architectures that improve generalization and reduce overfitting in sequence classification tasks. The findings could guide the development of more robust models in future stages, particularly with extensions involving self-supervised learning.",
  "Description": "Each experiment involves converting symbolic tokens to indices, padding sequences, embedding, pooling, and using linear classification. Metrics such as Macro-F1, SWA, and CWA are tracked. The experiments emphasize operational robustness, ensuring data handling and device management are efficient.",
