% This paper introduces a neuro-symbolic explanation framework using weighted signal temporal logic (wSTL) to generate interpretable explanations for robot policies. It also proposes novel evaluation metrics for explainability, such as conciseness and consistency, which can support the justification of using weighted accuracy metrics like Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) and Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) in the evaluation methodology. This citation should be included in the methodology section to strengthen the rationale for the chosen metrics.
