  "Experiment_description": "The conducted experiments focus on developing and evaluating neural-symbolic models for SPR sequence classification. Various nodes explore different embedding methods and feature integrations, such as whitespace tokenization, neural embeddings combined with symbolic features, and shape-color token embedding, to improve classification metrics like Composite Rule-Weighted Accuracy (CRWA), Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), and Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA).",
  "Significance": "These experiments are important as they establish a baseline for neural-symbolic models in SPR sequence classification and demonstrate the potential improvements when integrating symbolic features with neural embeddings. The findings provide insights into effective learning and generalization, highlighting the robustness of neural-symbolic approaches and suggesting directions for further research and model refinement.",
  "Description": "The methods involve converting SPR sequences into token representations, using various embedding and feature integration techniques to train classifiers. The models are evaluated using CRWA, SWA, and CWA metrics, with training and validation losses tracked to ensure effective learning and generalization. The experiments include mechanisms for data handling and fallback to synthetic datasets, ensuring reproducibility and robustness.",
