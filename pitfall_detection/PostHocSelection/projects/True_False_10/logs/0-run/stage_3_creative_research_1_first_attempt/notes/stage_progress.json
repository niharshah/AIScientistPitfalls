  "current_findings": "### Comprehensive Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Successful experiments often involved hyperparameter tuning, such as adjusting the number of epochs, model dimensions, or transformer layers. This tuning helped optimize model performance and prevent overfitting through early stopping.\n\n- **Neuro-Symbolic Integration**: Experiments that combined neural networks with symbolic features showed promising results. The integration of explicit symbolic features, such as shape and color counts, with neural embeddings enhanced the model's ability to generalize and perform zero-shot reasoning.\n\n- **Transformer Encoders**: The use of lightweight Transformer encoders to capture relational patterns in the data was a common theme in successful experiments. This approach improved the model's ability to reason about unseen rule combinations.\n\n- **Early Stopping and Cross-Entropy Optimization**: Implementing early stopping based on validation loss and optimizing with cross-entropy loss were effective strategies to prevent overfitting and improve model performance.\n\n- **Self-Contained and Efficient Scripts**: Successful experiments were often characterized by scripts that were self-contained, GPU-aware, and capable of running efficiently within a short time frame. This ensured reproducibility and ease of execution.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Bugs in Feature Extraction**: A common failure pattern was the presence of bugs in the feature extraction process, particularly in the symbolic feature computation. For example, incorrect list comprehensions or undefined variables led to execution failures.\n\n- **Overfitting on Validation Set**: Some experiments showed strong validation performance but a significant drop in test performance, indicating potential overfitting or a challenging test set.\n\n- **Complexity Without Clear Benefit**: Adding complexity, such as richer handcrafted features or broader hyperparameter sweeps, did not always translate to better performance. It sometimes introduced bugs or made the model more prone to overfitting.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Thorough Debugging of Feature Extraction**: Ensure that all feature extraction functions are thoroughly tested and debugged. Pay special attention to list comprehensions and variable definitions to avoid common errors like NameError.\n\n- **Balanced Complexity**: While adding complexity can improve model performance, it should be balanced with the risk of overfitting and increased susceptibility to bugs. Focus on integrating symbolic reasoning in a way that complements the neural components without unnecessary complexity.\n\n- **Robust Hyperparameter Tuning**: Continue to employ hyperparameter tuning, but focus on a targeted set of parameters that have shown to be impactful in previous experiments. Use early stopping to prevent overfitting and ensure generalization.\n\n- **Emphasize Reproducibility and Efficiency**: Maintain the practice of creating self-contained, efficient scripts that can run on both CPU and GPU. This will facilitate reproducibility and ease of experimentation.\n\n- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Ensure that evaluation metrics are comprehensive and include both validation and test performance. This will help identify overfitting early and guide adjustments to the experimental design.\n\nBy incorporating these insights and recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes and avoid the pitfalls observed in previous attempts, leading to more robust and generalizable models."
