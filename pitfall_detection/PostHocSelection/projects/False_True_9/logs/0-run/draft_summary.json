  "Experiment_description": "The experiments conducted focus on developing baseline models for SPR sequence classification. Node de7d5e562a724908b941c46f48417b33 uses a Bi-GRU encoder with SimCLR-style contrastive loss, while nodes 51edb58f0eeb48b2adfce152111207f5, 9501006aac1447e78d54f88b6fb613be, and 7f9d2dee3be844c6824b1533be6549a0 use a bi-directional LSTM with supervised learning.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are significant as they establish reliable benchmarks for the SPR task, demonstrate the effectiveness of LSTM in achieving high accuracy, and explore the potential of contrastive learning methods. The insights gained can guide future explorations in model enhancements and optimizations.",
  "Description": "The methods involve using different neural architectures for SPR sequence classification. The Bi-GRU model with contrastive learning aims to learn meaningful representations through a SimCLR-style loss, while the LSTM models process integer-encoded symbolic tokens through an embedding layer and a softmax classifier, evaluated with weighted accuracy metrics. These experiments provide foundational insights and establish a benchmark for future improvements.",
