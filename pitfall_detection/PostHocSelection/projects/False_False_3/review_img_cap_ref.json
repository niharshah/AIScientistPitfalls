        "Img_description": "The image contains only placeholder text 'example_learning_curve.png' and does not display an actual learning curve or any relevant graphical content.",
        "Img_review": "The figure is missing, as it only displays placeholder text. This is a critical issue because the absence of the visual data invalidates the ability to analyze the learning curve or verify the claims made in the caption and main text. The figure should be properly rendered or included in the submission.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption claims to describe a 'learning curve on the ambiguous dataset, showing erratic fluctuations and plateau,' but this cannot be verified due to the absence of the actual figure. The caption itself is concise and appropriately descriptive, assuming the figure were present, but without the figure, its accuracy remains unassessable.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure appropriately, describing its intended context and purpose (accuracy plateauing and attempts to address degraded performance). However, without the actual figure, these references are ineffective and unsupported. The submission must ensure the figure is present to validate these textual descriptions."
    },
    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "The provided image is a placeholder labeled 'example_confusion_matrix.png' with no actual content or visual elements typically associated with a confusion matrix. It lacks data, labels, and graphical representation.",
        "Img_review": "The figure fails to present any meaningful information as it is a placeholder rather than an actual confusion matrix. To improve, the figure should be replaced with a properly labeled confusion matrix that visualizes predictions versus actual classes, highlighting ambiguous or overlapping predictions as described in the caption and text.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption is misleading as it describes a confusion matrix that highlights ambiguous classes leading to overlapping predictions. However, the figure does not contain any such visualization or information. The caption should be updated or the placeholder should be replaced with a meaningful figure that aligns with the description.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references the figure as showing confusion matrices where ambiguous classes degrade performance, but this is inconsistent with the provided image, which is a placeholder. The references assume a detailed visualization, which is absent. The figure should be updated to match the description in the text, or the text should acknowledge the placeholder status of the figure."

    "figure_3": {
        "Img_description": "The figure is entirely blank and does not contain any visual elements such as graphs, axes, legends, or annotations. It is titled 'Ablation_Analyses.png.'",
        "Img_review": "The image lacks any content, making it impossible to assess the intended ablation analyses or label-correction strategies. Significant improvement is needed to include relevant data visualizations, proper labeling, and elements necessary for interpretation.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption, 'Ablation analyses (merged). Shows different label-correction strategies,' does not align with the figure. It fails to provide any meaningful or concise takeaway due to the absence of visual content in the figure.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references to Figure 3 describe combined ablation studies and negligible differences across label-correction strategies. However, these references are unsupported by the blank figure, rendering them ineffective. More specific elaboration on the expected insights would be beneficial, provided the figure is properly constructed."

    "figure_4": {
        "Img_description": "The image contains only the text 'Extended_Baseline_Metrics.png' and does not display any graphs, plots, or data representations.",
        "Img_review": "The image is a placeholder and does not contain any meaningful content for analysis. This is a significant issue as it prevents evaluation of the described findings. The actual figure should be uploaded to ensure the paper's claims are substantiated.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption, 'Extended baseline metrics (merged). Illustrates multiple views of baseline performance,' does not match the placeholder image. While the caption is concise and descriptive, it is unsupported in the absence of the actual figure.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The references in the main text describe the intended figure as containing extended bar plots and line graphs showcasing baseline performance metrics. However, without the actual figure, these references lack context and integration with the provided content."
