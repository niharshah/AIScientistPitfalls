  "Experiment_description": "The experiments at this stage focus on establishing baseline models for sequence classification using the SPR_BENCH dataset. Different configurations of token-level vocabularies, GRU classifiers, and mean-pooled embedding models are tested, with augmentation strategies being evaluated for their impact on model robustness.",
  "Significance": "These experiments are crucial for understanding the foundational performance of baseline models before introducing more complex techniques such as contrastive pre-training. The findings provide insights into the limitations of current strategies and guide future enhancements in model architecture and training approaches.",
  "Description": "The experiments involve constructing token-level vocabularies, encoding sequences to fixed lengths, and using either GRU or mean-pooled embedding models with linear classifiers. A shape-renaming augmentation strategy is applied to evaluate the augmentation consistency score (ACS) alongside standard metrics. The focus is on establishing a robust and reproducible baseline framework to assess model performance and generalization.",
