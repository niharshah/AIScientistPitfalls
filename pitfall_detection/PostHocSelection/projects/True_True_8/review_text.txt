    "Summary": "The paper examines symbolic consistency challenges in contrastive pretraining, highlighting pitfalls and partial gains. It reports on ablation experiments to understand how certain architectural components (e.g., projectors) impact performance in symbolic tasks.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper tackles a niche topic\u2014symbolic consistency in contrastive pretraining\u2014which could be relevant to structured domains.",
        "The inclusion of ablation studies is a positive aspect, as it attempts to identify critical components impacting performance."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper is vague and incomplete, with critical references missing (e.g., '[??]') and insufficient details about the methodology, dataset, or implementation.",
        "There is no clear novelty in the approach. The paper highlights challenges in symbolic consistency but does not propose any substantive solutions or novel frameworks to address these issues.",
        "Experimental validation is weak. The paper only mentions a 'small symbolic dataset' without describing its size, structure, or how it compares to existing datasets in this domain.",
        "Results are anecdotal and lack rigor. No baseline comparisons or quantitative analyses are provided to substantiate the claims.",
        "The writing quality is poor, with several vague statements and poorly constructed arguments. This makes it difficult to follow the technical content or assess the significance of the work."

    "Questions": [
        "What symbolic dataset was used, and what are its characteristics (e.g., size, class distribution, relevance)?",
        "How does this work compare to prior studies on symbolic consistency or contrastive pretraining? Are there any quantitative comparisons?",
        "What novel contributions or insights does this paper provide beyond identifying pitfalls?",
        "Why are critical references missing, and how does this impact the context of the paper?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not adequately address the limitations of its own methodology. For example, it does not explain why symbolic consistency is difficult to ensure or provide theoretical insights into the identified pitfalls.",
        "Potential negative impacts, such as biases in symbolic tasks or generalization issues, are not discussed."
