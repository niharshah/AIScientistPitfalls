Specifically, this involved experimenting with different embedding sizes (64, 128, 256) to identify the most effective configuration. Each configuration was tested by re-initializing and training the model for five epochs, and both the loss and ACS were logged on the development set. This methodical approach reflects a rigorous scientific method aimed at enhancing the model's performance and accuracy.\n\nIn the current plan, the focus shifts to fixing a specific implementation issue that caused a crash due to a name collision between two different \u201cDataset\u201d classes. This technical bug fix is essential to ensure the smooth functioning of the model pipeline. By renaming the imported Torch dataset to `TorchDataset` and keeping Hugging Face's as `HFDataset`, and ensuring the correct subclassing and attribute assignments, the plan addresses the crash issue effectively. Additionally, the plan now incorporates the computation of new metrics: Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), and their composite mean, Composite Weighted Accuracy (CoWA). These metrics are recorded at each epoch to provide a more nuanced evaluation of the model's performance, adding depth to the analysis of the model's capabilities.\n\nThe integration of these plans represents a comprehensive approach that not only strengthens the model's baseline through hyperparameter tuning but also ensures robustness and functionality through bug fixes and the introduction of additional performance metrics.

Contrastive Learning: Contrastive learning has shown substantial improvements in learning effective feature representations across various domains (Chen et al., 2020; He et al., 2020). Studies like Guo et al. (2021) and Li et al. (2023) demonstrate how contrastive learning can be enhanced with advanced data augmentation and denoising techniques, which can be adapted for symbolic sequences.\n2. Symbolic Reasoning: Traditional methods for symbolic reasoning often rely on extensive labeled data and struggle with generalization (Evans et al., 2018; Selsam et al., 2019). Incorporating contrastive learning can alleviate these issues by leveraging unlabeled data to learn more generalizable representations.\n3. SPR_BENCH Benchmark: The SPR_BENCH dataset provides a standardized benchmark for evaluating symbolic pattern recognition models. Current SOTA methods rely on supervised learning, achieving 65.0% SWA and 70.0% CWA, leaving room for improvement with innovative approaches.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis research proposes leveraging context-aware self-supervised contrastive learning to enhance feature representations for the Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) task. The SPR task involves classifying symbolic sequences governed by hidden logical rules, with significant potential for applications in automated reasoning systems. We hypothesize that context-aware contrastive learning, combined with advanced data augmentation and denoising techniques, can create more robust and generalizable embeddings of symbolic sequences. These embeddings can then be fine-tuned for the specific SPR task. We will design a context-aware contrastive learning framework tailored to the symbolic nature of the SPR_BENCH dataset and evaluate its performance using Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) and Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) metrics. The proposed approach aims to surpass the current SOTA performance of 65.0% SWA and 70.0% CWA, demonstrating the effectiveness of contrastive learning in symbolic pattern recognition.\n\n## Experiments\n\n1. Context-aware Contrastive Learning Framework Design:\n- Develop a context-aware contrastive learning framework tailored for symbolic sequences.\n- Incorporate advanced data augmentation techniques (e.g., token shuffling, token masking) and denoising strategies to create positive and negative pairs based on sequence similarity and dissimilarity in terms of shape and color complexity.\n\n2. Pre-training on Unlabeled Data:\n- Pre-train the model on unlabeled sequences from the SPR_BENCH dataset using the context-aware contrastive learning framework.\n- Evaluate the quality of learned embeddings using visualization techniques (e.g., t-SNE) and clustering metrics.\n\n3. Fine-tuning for SPR Task:\n- Fine-tune the pre-trained model on the labeled train split of the SPR_BENCH dataset.\n- Use the dev split for hyperparameter tuning and model selection.\n\n4. Evaluation:\n- Evaluate the model on the test split using the chosen metric (either SWA or CWA).\n- Compare the performance against the current SOTA.\n\n## Risk Factors And Limitations\n\n1. Complexity of Contrastive Learning: Designing effective positive and negative pairs for symbolic sequences may be challenging and could impact the quality of learned embeddings.\n2. Generalization: Although contrastive learning aims to improve generalization, there is a risk that the learned embeddings may not transfer well to the specific SPR task.\n3. Computational Resources: Pre-training a contrastive learning model on large symbolic sequences may require substantial computational resources, which could be a limitation for some academic labs.\n\n## Code To Potentially Use\n\nUse the following code as context for your experiments:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSPR.py\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nUtility to load the SPR_BENCH benchmark datasets\nUsing HuggingFace\u2019s `datasets` library.\n\nDirectory layout expected\nSPR_BENCH/\n \u251c\u2500 train.csv   (20000 rows)\n \u251c\u2500 dev.csv     (5000 rows)\n \u2514\u2500 test.csv    (10000 rows)\n\nEach CSV has header:  id,sequence,label\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n$ pip install datasets   # once\n\"\"\"\nimport pathlib\nfrom typing import Dict\n\nfrom datasets import load_dataset, DatasetDict                                         # <- no pandas import\n\n\ndef load_spr_bench(root: pathlib.Path) -> DatasetDict:\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a DatasetDict {'train':\u2026, 'dev':\u2026, 'test':\u2026} for one SPR ID folder.\n    \"\"\"\n    def _load(split_csv: str):\n        return load_dataset(\n            \"csv\",\n            data_files=str(root / split_csv),\n            split=\"train\",           # treat csv as a single split\n            cache_dir=\".cache_dsets\" # optional; keeps HF cache tidy\n        )\n\n    dset = DatasetDict()\n    dset[\"train\"] = _load(\"train.csv\")\n    dset[\"dev\"]   = _load(\"dev.csv\")\n    dset[\"test\"]  = _load(\"test.csv\")\n    return dset\n\n\ndef count_shape_variety(sequence: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Count the number of unique shape types in the sequence\"\"\"\n    return len(set(token[0] for token in sequence.strip().split() if token))\n\ndef count_color_variety(sequence: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Count the number of unique color types in the sequence\"\"\"\n    return len(set(token[1] for token in sequence.strip().split() if len(token) > 1))\n\ndef shape_weighted_accuracy(sequences, y_true, y_pred):\n    \"\"\"Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA)\"\"\"\n    weights = [count_shape_variety(seq) for seq in sequences]\n    correct = [w if yt == yp else 0 for w, yt, yp in zip(weights, y_true, y_pred)]\n    return sum(correct) / sum(weights) if sum(weights) > 0 else 0.0\n\ndef color_weighted_accuracy(sequences, y_true, y_pred):\n    \"\"\"Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA)\"\"\"\n    weights = [count_color_variety(seq) for seq in sequences]\n    correct = [w if yt == yp else 0 for w, yt, yp in zip(weights, y_true, y_pred)]\n    return sum(correct) / sum(weights) if sum(weights) > 0 else 0.0\n\n\ndef main():\n\n    ## Absolute path of the datasets\n    DATA_PATH = pathlib.Path('/home/zxl240011/AI-Scientist-v2/SPR_BENCH/')\n    spr_bench = load_spr_bench(DATA_PATH)\n\n    print(\"Benchmarks split:\", spr_bench.keys())\n\n    # Demo: show first example from SPR_BENCH\u2011train\n    ex = spr_bench[\"train\"][0]\n    print(\"\\nExample row:\")\n    print(ex)          \n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\n\n```\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- The aggregator script must load existing .npy experiment data from the \"exp_results_npy_files\" fields (ONLY using full and exact file paths in the summary JSONs) for thorough plotting.\n- It should call os.makedirs(\"figures\", exist_ok=True) before saving any plots.\n- Aim for a balance of empirical results, ablations, and diverse, informative visuals in 'figures/' that comprehensively showcase the finalized research outcomes.\n- If you need .npy paths from the summary, only copy those paths directly (rather than copying and parsing the entire summary).\n\nYour generated Python script must:\n1) Load or refer to relevant data and .npy files from these summaries.

Additionally, it includes computing and recording performance metrics such as Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), and Composite Weighted Accuracy (CoWA).

Contrastive Learning: Contrastive learning has shown substantial improvements in learning effective feature representations across various domains (Chen et al., 2020; He et al., 2020). Studies like Guo et al. (2021) and Li et al. (2023) demonstrate how contrastive learning can be enhanced with advanced data augmentation and denoising techniques, which can be adapted for symbolic sequences.\n2. Symbolic Reasoning: Traditional methods for symbolic reasoning often rely on extensive labeled data and struggle with generalization (Evans et al., 2018; Selsam et al., 2019). Incorporating contrastive learning can alleviate these issues by leveraging unlabeled data to learn more generalizable representations.\n3. SPR_BENCH Benchmark: The SPR_BENCH dataset provides a standardized benchmark for evaluating symbolic pattern recognition models. Current SOTA methods rely on supervised learning, achieving 65.0% SWA and 70.0% CWA, leaving room for improvement with innovative approaches.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis research proposes leveraging context-aware self-supervised contrastive learning to enhance feature representations for the Synthetic PolyRule Reasoning (SPR) task. The SPR task involves classifying symbolic sequences governed by hidden logical rules, with significant potential for applications in automated reasoning systems. We hypothesize that context-aware contrastive learning, combined with advanced data augmentation and denoising techniques, can create more robust and generalizable embeddings of symbolic sequences. These embeddings can then be fine-tuned for the specific SPR task. We will design a context-aware contrastive learning framework tailored to the symbolic nature of the SPR_BENCH dataset and evaluate its performance using Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA) and Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA) metrics. The proposed approach aims to surpass the current SOTA performance of 65.0% SWA and 70.0% CWA, demonstrating the effectiveness of contrastive learning in symbolic pattern recognition.\n\n## Experiments\n\n1. Context-aware Contrastive Learning Framework Design:\n- Develop a context-aware contrastive learning framework tailored for symbolic sequences.\n- Incorporate advanced data augmentation techniques (e.g., token shuffling, token masking) and denoising strategies to create positive and negative pairs based on sequence similarity and dissimilarity in terms of shape and color complexity.\n\n2. Pre-training on Unlabeled Data:\n- Pre-train the model on unlabeled sequences from the SPR_BENCH dataset using the context-aware contrastive learning framework.\n- Evaluate the quality of learned embeddings using visualization techniques (e.g., t-SNE) and clustering metrics.\n\n3. Fine-tuning for SPR Task:\n- Fine-tune the pre-trained model on the labeled train split of the SPR_BENCH dataset.\n- Use the dev split for hyperparameter tuning and model selection.\n\n4. Evaluation:\n- Evaluate the model on the test split using the chosen metric (either SWA or CWA).\n- Compare the performance against the current SOTA.\n\n## Risk Factors And Limitations\n\n1. Complexity of Contrastive Learning: Designing effective positive and negative pairs for symbolic sequences may be challenging and could impact the quality of learned embeddings.\n2. Generalization: Although contrastive learning aims to improve generalization, there is a risk that the learned embeddings may not transfer well to the specific SPR task.\n3. Computational Resources: Pre-training a contrastive learning model on large symbolic sequences may require substantial computational resources, which could be a limitation for some academic labs.\n\n## Code To Potentially Use\n\nUse the following code as context for your experiments:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSPR.py\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nUtility to load the SPR_BENCH benchmark datasets\nUsing HuggingFace\u2019s `datasets` library.\n\nDirectory layout expected\nSPR_BENCH/\n \u251c\u2500 train.csv   (20000 rows)\n \u251c\u2500 dev.csv     (5000 rows)\n \u2514\u2500 test.csv    (10000 rows)\n\nEach CSV has header:  id,sequence,label\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n$ pip install datasets   # once\n\"\"\"\nimport pathlib\nfrom typing import Dict\n\nfrom datasets import load_dataset, DatasetDict                                         # <- no pandas import\n\n\ndef load_spr_bench(root: pathlib.Path) -> DatasetDict:\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a DatasetDict {'train':\u2026, 'dev':\u2026, 'test':\u2026} for one SPR ID folder.\n    \"\"\"\n    def _load(split_csv: str):\n        return load_dataset(\n            \"csv\",\n            data_files=str(root / split_csv),\n            split=\"train\",           # treat csv as a single split\n            cache_dir=\".cache_dsets\" # optional; keeps HF cache tidy\n        )\n\n    dset = DatasetDict()\n    dset[\"train\"] = _load(\"train.csv\")\n    dset[\"dev\"]   = _load(\"dev.csv\")\n    dset[\"test\"]  = _load(\"test.csv\")\n    return dset\n\n\ndef count_shape_variety(sequence: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Count the number of unique shape types in the sequence\"\"\"\n    return len(set(token[0] for token in sequence.strip().split() if token))\n\ndef count_color_variety(sequence: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Count the number of unique color types in the sequence\"\"\"\n    return len(set(token[1] for token in sequence.strip().split() if len(token) > 1))\n\ndef shape_weighted_accuracy(sequences, y_true, y_pred):\n    \"\"\"Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA)\"\"\"\n    weights = [count_shape_variety(seq) for seq in sequences]\n    correct = [w if yt == yp else 0 for w, yt, yp in zip(weights, y_true, y_pred)]\n    return sum(correct) / sum(weights) if sum(weights) > 0 else 0.0\n\ndef color_weighted_accuracy(sequences, y_true, y_pred):\n    \"\"\"Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA)\"\"\"\n    weights = [count_color_variety(seq) for seq in sequences]\n    correct = [w if yt == yp else 0 for w, yt, yp in zip(weights, y_true, y_pred)]\n    return sum(correct) / sum(weights) if sum(weights) > 0 else 0.0\n\n\ndef main():\n\n    ## Absolute path of the datasets\n    DATA_PATH = pathlib.Path('/home/zxl240011/AI-Scientist-v2/SPR_BENCH/')\n    spr_bench = load_spr_bench(DATA_PATH)\n\n    print(\"Benchmarks split:\", spr_bench.keys())\n\n    # Demo: show first example from SPR_BENCH\u2011train\n    ex = spr_bench[\"train\"][0]\n    print(\"\\nExample row:\")\n    print(ex)          \n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\n\n```\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- The aggregator script must load existing .npy experiment data from the \"exp_results_npy_files\" fields (ONLY using full and exact file paths in the summary JSONs) for thorough plotting.\n- It should call os.makedirs(\"figures\", exist_ok=True) before saving any plots.\n- Aim for a balance of empirical results, ablations, and diverse, informative visuals in 'figures/' that comprehensively showcase the finalized research outcomes.\n- If you need .npy paths from the summary, only copy those paths directly (rather than copying and parsing the entire summary).\n\nYour generated Python script must:\n1) Load or refer to relevant data and .npy files from these summaries.

Additionally, it includes computing and recording performance metrics such as Shape-Weighted Accuracy (SWA), Color-Weighted Accuracy (CWA), and Composite Weighted Accuracy (CoWA). The second objective is to implement a SimCLR-style contrastive pre-training scheme to enhance model performance. This involves using stochastic augmentations to learn contextual sequence embeddings with an Embedding + Bi-GRU architecture, followed by fine-tuning with a linear classifier. The plan aims to track validation loss and weighted accuracies, including the newly introduced Complexity-Weighted Accuracy (CompWA).
