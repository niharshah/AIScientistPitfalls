# Symbolic Pattern Recognition with Deep Learning and Symbolic Reasoning

This repository contains the implementation and experimental results of our research on combining deep learning with symbolic reasoning for Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR) tasks. We propose a hybrid model that integrates Vision Transformers for feature extraction with a hybrid rule inference engine to manage symbolic logic.

## Overview

Our work aims to tackle the challenging problem of determining whether a given sequence of abstract symbols satisfies a hidden target rule. This task is complex due to the variety and intricacies of symbolic sequences, requiring both effective feature extraction and precise rule-based reasoning.

## Methodology

### Vision Transformers

We utilize pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViT) which are adept at capturing hierarchical information in sequences and are well-suited for processing symbolic data.

### Hybrid Rule Inference Engine

The rule inference engine is constructed using differentiable programming frameworks and symbolic logic systems like Prolog to facilitate learning and rule interpretation. This allows the model to dynamically adapt the rules during training.

## Experimental Setup

The model was evaluated on synthetic datasets, namely IDWEP, TEZGR, LYGES, and GURSG, each offering unique challenges in terms of symbolic complexity and hidden rules. We used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics.

## Results

Our results show variability in model performance across datasets, achieving the highest accuracy on GURSG (75%) and a lower accuracy on TEZGR and LYGES (52%). This highlights the model's strengths and the influence of dataset characteristics on performance.

## Future Work

Future research will focus on refining the model architecture, exploring advanced optimization techniques, and expanding training datasets to enhance the model's generalizability and robustness across varied symbolic patterns.
