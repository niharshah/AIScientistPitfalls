# Hybrid GNN-CNN Model for Symbolic Pattern Recognition

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a novel hybrid model that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to tackle Symbolic Pattern Recognition (SPR) tasks. This model is designed to effectively capture both topological structures and sequential patterns in symbolic data, overcoming existing challenges in document analysis, symbolic reasoning, and related fields.

## Key Features
- **Hybrid Model Architecture**: Integrates the strengths of GNNs for structural learning and CNNs for sequence pattern recognition.
- **Symbolic Reasoning Layer**: Utilizes a grammar parser to extract rules and impose logical constraints on symbolic data.
- **Bayesian Networks**: Used for probabilistic inference, uncovering hidden relationships, and validating rule adherence.
- **Synthetic Dataset**: Includes symbolic sequences with varying complexities and degradations for training and evaluation.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved a remarkable accuracy rate of 100% in experimental evaluations, demonstrating robustness under noise and perturbations.
